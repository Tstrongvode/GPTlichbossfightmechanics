        InterpolationTypes

Classes and Structs
Name 	Description
cubic_bezier_parameters 	

A structure for defining Bezier interpolation parameters. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve for more info on Bezier curves.
keyframe_delta 	

Instead of specifying the actual keyframe positions, we specify the keyframe deltas. This allows us to treat the initial position of the prop as keyframe 0 and avoid the question of how to get the prop to its initial location. For a animation_mode.Loop animation, the net rotation and translation must both be zero. Each delta is interpreted as a world-space transformation to be concatenated onto the previous transform(s).
animation_controller 	

Used to move and animate the position of creative_prop objects.

    See creative_prop.GetAnimationController for information on acquiring an instance of an animation_controller for a given creative_prop.
    See SetAnimation for details on authoring movement and animations.
