Accolade Devices

With the Accolade device, you can set up your islands so players will earn Battle Pass XP when they interact with your island. Accolades are achievements or accomplishments that players can complete to earn XP.

There is a sample island that includes multiple accolades, which you can visit to see how they work. The island code for this sample island is 2034-7205-6925. To play through this island, from the Creative lobby click CHANGE to open the Discover screen. Click the ISLAND CODE tab, then enter the island code for the sample Accolades island in the box and press Enter. The window will display information about the island. Click PLAY to launch the game.

In general, the Accolade device is designed to work with other devices, and players can't interact with it directly. To grant XP to your players, other devices must send signals to the Accolade device when the players do certain things.

The Accolade device takes very little memory. The first Accolade device placed uses 88 memory; each one placed after the first uses 8 memory.

Some devices have a limit on how many times that device can be placed on an island. This is independent of how much memory the device uses. You can only place this device 30 times on an island.
Understanding XP Award Weights

When you place an Accolade device, you are able to set the XP Award amount to Very Small, Small, Medium, Large, and Very Large. The amount is not a set amount of XP. Instead it is weighted. This means a different amount is granted depending on a set of criteria. This happens in the background and is not something creators can customize.

The amount of XP granted is based on how many Accolade devices you have on your island plus how frequently an accolade is awarded. High-frequency accolades result in smaller XP amounts. Low frequency accolades result in higher XP amounts. For example, if you have an accolade with a Very Large XP Award and high award frequency, and you have an accolade with a Very Small XP Award with low award frequency, then the Very Small Award may actually give more XP to a player than the Very Large Award.

When you set up your accolades, think about the complexity of the accolade and how often it can be achieved. This will help you determine what XP Award weight is appropriate for that accolade.

When your island is published, it will go through a calibration process to evaluate how often players receive each accolade compared to how long they play. The calibration system requires a number of play sessions over time in order to make the calculations it needs to accurately calibrate the island. Once calibration is complete, the weights for each level of XP award are determined.

If you edit your island and adjust the XP Award option in the Accolade devices, you will need to republish your island so it can be recalibrated.

Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
Device Options

Basic options provide a way to name, describe and weight your awards. Other options control visibility, how the device is triggered, and who can trigger it.

Best Practices

Here are some best practices for using the Accolade device.

    Make it clear how accolades are awarded. Name them well, and consider providing a list of accolades in your game's lobby.
    All players should get accolades when playing a full game. It is appropriate to reward skill and winning tactics, but the awards granted should not be too uneven. It's good to have some awards that all players can get. You can do this with a passive award, such as playing time, or it could still be a skill-based option if all players are likely to be at the same skill level. For example, having an Elimination accolade in a game mode where every player is likely to get some eliminations is fine.
    Accolades should be awarded for the main gameplay element of your game. A free-for-all game should give awards for eliminations. A game where you race around a course should give awards for completing the track. You might have some separate awards for other elements, but the main award should line up with the game.
    One type of action should correspond to one Accolade reward. Don't set up an Accolade device to be triggered by multiple possible actions.
    How frequently accolades should be awarded depends on the type of game. An accolade that awards XP with a frequency of less than one second is too frequent, and might seem like spam. Every 2 to 10 minutes on average is suitable for most games. A game that is expected to last more than 45 minutes could award them even less frequently. An action-packed game where every elimination is awarded, such as a team Free-for-all, might have more frequent rewards.
    In general, players should not get several accolades at once. An exception to this is at the end of a game. In that case, a player might receive one accolade for the action ending the game, one for winning the game, and one for participating.
    Make sure the accolade is rewarding an achievable goal. Accolades that trigger infrequently may grant high XP rewards, but may result in less efficient XP payouts overall. For example, if there is an accolade for completing level 300 in a 300-level Skillrun, most players will not be able to reach that level and the accolade might be triggered too infrequently to register during calibration.
    Make sure the accolade can be awarded within a few hours of play. It can be cool to have accolades that are more rare, but keep in mind that during the initial calibration of the game, accolades have to be triggered by players before any XP values can be assigned. Players should be able to achieve most of your accolades within a few hours of play.
    Keep in mind that XP gains have diminishing returns. When a player reaches a certain threshold of XP gained across all Creative games, they will get less and less XP for each accolade earned. This happens no matter what the set XP weight of a particular accolade is. If a player repeats the same actions, or plays the same game over and over, this also triggers a steady decrease in the amount of XP earned each time. This is called "diminishing returns" and happens automatically. It is not something a creator can customize or affect.

Design Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use the Accolade device.
Example 1: Using the Tracker Device to Trigger Accolades

The Tracker device is great to use when you are getting started with the Accolade device, because the Tracker already has a large list of built-in conditions and objectives. This means you can get started awarding XP to players right away because you don't need to create your own achievements or goals.

To establish the connection between the Tracker and Accolade devices:

    Open the Customize panel for the Tracker device, and select the Stat to Track option. Pick a stat you want to use for your accolade.
    Select a value for the Target Value option. This sets the number of times the player must perform the action in order for the Tracker to complete.
    In the Tracker's channel options, select an unused channel for the When Complete Transmit On option. This means that when the Tracker completes, it sends a signal on this channel.
    Now open the Customize panel for the Accolade device, and select the Award When Receiving From channel option. Select the same channel as the one you chose for the When Complete Transmit On option in the Tracker device.
    When the Tracker completes, it sends a signal to the Accolade device to indicate the criteria for the accolade is met. When it receives the signal, the Accolade device awards the triggering player with XP.

Example 2: Use Multiple Trackers for Complex Goals

You can also use several Tracker devices that feed into another single Tracker device that signals the Accolade device. With this setup you can create more complex accolades. For example, you can set up an accolade for eliminating 5 players and 5 NPCs. Here's how:

    Set up Tracker A by setting the Stat to Track option to Eliminations, set the Target Value option to 5, and set the Player Eliminations Count option to Yes.
    Set up Tracker B by setting the Stat to Track option to Eliminations and set the Target Value option to 5. Set the Player Eliminations Count option to No, and set the Non Player Eliminations Count option to Yes.
    For both Tracker A and Tracker B, set the When Complete Transmit On option to Channel 1.
    Set up Tracker C by setting the Stat to Track option to Channel, the Target Value option to 2, and the Increment Progress When Receiving From option to Channel 1. Set the When Complete Transmit On option to Channel 2.
    In the Accolade device, set the Award When Receiving From option to Channel 2. When Tracker A and B are completed (when they both reach the Target Value), they each send a signal to Tracker C, which completes when it receives both signals. Tracker C then sends a signal to the Accolade device and the accolade is awarded.

Example 3: Creating Location-Based Accolades

You can set up Trigger devices to award accolades when players reach particular locations in your island.

    Place a Trigger device at the location you want players to reach.
    Set up the Trigger by setting the Triggered by Player option to On.
    Set the Trigger's When Triggered Transmit On option to an unused channel.
    In the Accolade device options, set the Award When Receiving From option to the same channel the Trigger's signal transmits on.

Designer's Tip

This could be a good accolade for islands with hidden locations, or islands where exploration is an important part of the experience.

Advanced Storm Beacon Devices

Customize individual storm phases when you use the Advanced Storm Controller.
Creative
Advanced Storm Beacon Devices

Advanced Storm Beacon devices are used in conjunction with the Advanced Storm Controller device. You can use an Advanced Storm Controller to set up a multi-phased storm, then use Advanced Storm Beacons to customize each phase of the storm.

Inside the storm circle is the safe area for players.

When Advanced Storm Beacons are placed with an Advanced Storm Controller, they influence the controller storm only if the Storm Phases option for the controller is set to Custom.
Finding and Placing the Device

Click image to expand.

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the CREATIVE inventory screen.
    Click the DEVICES tab and scroll to select the device. You can also use the Search box or the Categories panel on the left to find your device.

    Press Esc to return to your island in Create mode. Use your phone tool to position the device, then left-click to place it. Press Esc to detach the device from your phone.
    Point at the device with your phone. If the CUSTOMIZE popup doesn't open immediately, move closer until it does, then press E to open the CUSTOMIZE panel.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to rename them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
Device Options

To customize the phases of a multi-phase storm, each phase will have to be defined. Setting the Phase with a custom phase number will apply the customized options to that phase only.

To use same behaviors for each phase, customize the first beacon, then copy it for each phase it will apply to and change the phase number.

If you're using a lot of beacons, it's a good idea to rename each beacon with its associated phase in the name, as shown in the image below.
Prompt showing a customized beacon name

You can configure this device with the following options.

Gameplay Examples Using the Advanced Storm Controller Device
Battle Royale Storm
Battle Royale or Zone Wars Example

The simplest approach to building a Battle Royale-like storm phase is to place an Advanced Storm Controller on your island and leave the Storm Phase option set to Default. This will generate a randomly moving storm with ten phases, and with each phase shrinking in size.

The storm's behaviors can be customized by setting the Bounds Radius and Phase One Radius options in a way that limits the storm's movement. However, to have precise control over the storm's movement and damage, instead of relying on the default settings, you can add an Advanced Storm Beacon for each phase. By setting options in both the storm controller and the individual beacons you associate with it, you can fully customize the storm to your exact game needs.
Zone Wars Tutorial

Using the Advanced Storm Controller and Advanced Storm Beacons to build a Battle Royale experience is similar to what was done in the Zone Wars full island tutorial.

Zone Wars is a simulation of the end-game scenario in Battle Royale with a condensed moving zone. Eliminate the competition as you avoid the storm closing in. Randomized spawns and inventory items make each round unique.

    AI Patrol Path Node Devices

AI Patrol Path Node Devices

Add patrol paths for guards to increase the challenge of your game.
Creative
AI Patrol Path Node Devices

Use the AI Patrol Path Node device to create simple or complex patrolling behavior for guards spawned with the Guard Spawner device.

Place the device where you want to start a patrol path. Using your phone tool, place additional nodes (points) to mark the patrol path (use the hotkey control for placing or copying). The nodes will all be connected by a colored line, which will have directional arrows based on the patrol behavior you choose in the device options. You can use the phone tool to remove a node by using the control for cutting or deleting. See the image below for an example.
Placing the Device and Appending Nodes

The Copy and Cut hotkeys change to Append Node and Move Node when you're working with this device.

Paths can be straight or curved, and can go up and down stairs or slopes. You can create many different patrol paths, and set other devices to send signals that cause guards to switch from one path to another.

Some devices have a limit on how many times that device can be placed on an island. This is independent of how much memory the device uses. You can place up to 128 AI Patrol Path Node devices on your island. For each device, you can set up to 128 individual path nodes.

Design Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use the AI Patrol Path Node device.

    Door Spotted
    Guard Hire

Door Spotted

The action of a guard sighting a player can send a signal to other devices. Here is an example of a mechanic that can be implemented into a game that uses this.

You will need the following devices.

    1 x Guard Spawner
    3 x AI Patrol Path Nodes
    1 x Lock
    1 x Player Spawner
    1 x Item Granter

    Create a simple hallway in an L shape, with a door at one side, and alcoves to hide in.

    Place an AI Patrol Path Node on one end of the L-shaped structure. Customize it to the following settings.
    Door Path
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Patrol Path Group 	Group 1 	The name of the AI patrol path you created.

    Copy and paste the initial AI Patrol Path Node. Set up two more that traverse around the corner and to the end of the L-shaped hallway.

    Set a Guard Spawner in a convenient location on the map where you can group global devices. Customize it to the following settings.
    Door Guard
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Number of Guards 	1 	Maximum number of guards that can spawn at a time.
    Total Spawn Limit 	1 	Total spawns of guards as they are eliminated.
    Spawn Radius 	2.5M 	Distance from the spawner that a guard can appear.
    Spawn On Patrol Path 	Group 1 	The AI Patrol Path that the guards will spawn on and follow.
    When Alerted To Player Transmit On 	Channel 2 	When a guard identifies a player, they will send a signal to this channel.
    When Eliminated Transmit On 	Channel 3 	When the guard is eliminated, a signal is sent to this channel.

    In front of the open door, set a Lock device and customize it to the following settings.
    Door Lock
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Initial Door Position 	Open 	When the match starts, the door will automatically be open.
    Open When Receiving From 	Channel 3 	Upon receiving the signal from eliminating the guard, the door will be opened.
    Close When Receiving From 	Channel 2 	Upon being sighted by the guard, the door will automatically close and lock.

    Within a protected alcove that has cover to block a guard's line of sight if the player crouches, place a Player Spawner. Customize it to the following settings.
    Door Spawner
    Option 	Value 	Description
    When Player Spawned Transmit On 	Channel 1 	When the player spawns, a signal is sent to an Item Granter to award a weapon.

    Place an Item Granter next to the Guard Spawner. Register an assault rifle to it, then customize it to the following settings.
    Door Path
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Equip Granted Item 	First Item 	The first item registered to the Item Granter is automatically equipped on spawn.
    Grant Item When Receiving From 	Channel 1 	When the player initially spawns, they are awarded and equipped with the registered weapon.

You now have the basic functionality for having a door close and lock when a player is sighted by a guard, and unlocked when the player eliminates the guard.

As an alternative to having a player defeat the guard, you can have a button that the player can push to unlock the door. Navigating it through stealth will then become mandatory, or a player can return after eliminating the guards and try again.

You could also set the device to cause all guards to go on alert, or spawn hostile Sentry devices in chokepoints, suddenly making the level significantly more dangerous.
Guard Hire

Guards, like other AIs such as boars and wolves, can also be recruited by the player to help them in combat.

You will need the following devices.

    4 x Guard Spawner
    2 x AI Patrol Path Nodes
    1 x Player Spawner

    Create a small T-shaped hallway with a safe spawning alcove at the bottom of the T.

    Place the Player Spawner in the alcove, using it's default settings.

    Place a Guard Spawner within the alcove. Customize it to the following settings.

    Hire Spawner 1 Hire Spawner 2
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Number of Guards 	1 	The number of guards spawned by the device at one time.
    Team 	Team 1 	Set to the same team as the player's default.
    Spawn Timer 	1 Second 	Guards are spawned after a one second delay.
    Spawn Through Walls 	Off 	The guards cannot spawn past walls within their spawn radius.
    Spawn Radius 	2.5M 	The maximum distance a guard can spawn from its spawner.
    Patrol Option 	Disable Patrol 	Guards will stand in their initial spawn location instead of patrolling around.
    Can Be Hired 	Yes 	By interacting with the guards, you can have them follow you.

    Copy two more of this Spawn Manager and place them all within the alcove.

    Place an AI Patrol Path Node on one end of the T juncture hallway. Customize it to the following settings.
    AI Patrol Path Node Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Patrol Path Group 	Group 1 	The name of the AI patrol path for Guards to use.

    Copy and place a second AI Patrol Path Node on the other end of the hallway.

    Place a fourth Guard Spawner anywhere on the level, and customize it to the following settings.
    Enemy Guard Spawner
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Guard Type 	Ghost 	The physical model of the guard used.
    Number Of Guards 	2 	Maximum number of guards that can be spawned at once.
    Total Spawn Limit 	2 	Total number of guards that can be spawned.

    Spawn On Patrol Path Group 	Group 1 	Guards will spawn on the patrol path and follow it instead of spawn near the guard spawner.

Air Vent Devices

This device boosts players up into the air.
Creative
Air Vent Devices

An air vent is primarily used as a method of moving characters in game modes. By standing on it, players are projected upward by the gust of air coming from the vent. It can also knock other objects (such as vehicles, balls, or projectiles) up into the air. If the air vent is placed on a wall, it will knock players or objects in the direction the gust blows. There are three types of vents in the Air Vent Gallery:

    A mechanical air vent (like you see on buildings)
    A steam vent surrounded by rocks
    A steam vent with purple alien energy surrounded by rocks.

The mechanical air vent is a device that can be customized. The two steam vents can't be customized, but can be placed as environmental props.

Device Options

In its default state, the air vent knocks players into the air by a moderate amount when they enter an area up to 3 meters above the fans. Players entering the air vent will not take fall damage, and can re-deploy their gliders.

This device has some basic functionality, like setting the range of the gust, and how much force the gust has. Additionally, there are some advanced options, like changing the amount of force depending on where the player enters the gust's range.

You can configure this device with the following options.

Default values are bold.
Basic Options
Option 	Values 	Description
Visible During Game 	On, Off 	Determines whether the device is visible during the game. This affects the device's collision properties.

Channels

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.
Receivers

Receivers listen on a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.
Option 	Values 	Description
Enable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	Enables the device when it receives a signal on the selected channel.
Disable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	Disables the device when it receives a signal on the selected channel.
Activate When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	If the device is disabled, this will enable the device for one second, then disable it again. This creates a sudden, individual gust.

Armored Battle Bus Spawner Device

Trick out your map with an Armored Battle Bus players can drive and use to destroy buildings and eliminate other players.
Creative
Armored Battle Bus Spawner Device

The Armored Battle Bus is a battle-hardened addition to available vehicles. Creators can place an Armored Battle Bus on the island to a specific location and orientation. This vehicle has unique features, including:

    Up to 3 players can man the vehicle — one driver and two players on turrets mounted in the front and rear of the bus.
    It can instantly destroy vegetation, rocks, and most buildings when a player drives the bus into them.
    Turrets mounted on the Armored Battle Bus are equipped with scopes.
    It can interact with the Fuel Pump Device for refueling.

Some devices have a limit on how many times that device can be placed on an island. This is independent of how much memory the device uses. You can only place this device 16 times on an island, but if you use a number of other vehicle types on your island, this number becomes fewer than 16.

Attribute Evaluator Devices

This device monitors a channel and transmits a signal based on the attributes of any player who triggers a device on that channel.
Creative
Attribute Evaluator Devices

The Attribute Evaluator only works with signals received from other devices. It acts as branching logic, and checks whether the player that sent the signal passes all of the tests that are set up for this trigger. Then the trigger sends a signal on either a success channel or a failure channel. With this trigger, you can test whether a player has reached a specific condition, and determine what happens when that occurs.

The attribute evaluator checks against the stats of the player at the point it is activated. If it receives a signal from an event that changes one of the player's stats (for example, if it receives a signal from the Elimination Manager that a player has just eliminated an enemy), the player's stats might not have been updated from that event. See Loo Roll Rush for an example of this problem.

Audio Mixer Devices
Creative
Audio Mixer Devices

You can use the Audio Mixer device to adjust the volume for groups of sounds. This gives you dynamic and automatic control of a game’s volume mix, much like a professional mixing console would.

With the Audio Mixer, you can adjust the volume level of sounds that are already in Fortnite (such as weapons, character footsteps, and vehicles). If you work on your island as a project in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), you can create custom sound waves and sound cues that can be controlled with the Audio Mixer as well. See Audio Mixer Device page in the UEFN documentation for more information about using the device in UEFN.
Control Bus

In UEFN, the control bus is a way to control certain parameters for one or more sounds. There are several control buses set up to control the volume of the sounds that occur in Fortnite by default. If you don't have a control bus mix set up, or you aren't using UEFN to work on your island, you can choose a default control bus using the Bus option in the Audio Mixer device options. The following table lists the default control buses available.

If you want to control the volume of multiple buses in Creative, you'll need to place an Audio Mixer device for each bus you want to control.
Control Bus Name 	Description
Music 	Used to set the volume of music (this includes emote music).
SFX 	Used to set the volume of all sound effects.
Ambience 	Used to set the volume of ambient sounds.
Explosions 	Used to set the volume of explosion sounds.
Footsteps 	Used to set the volume of character footsteps.
Gadgets 	Used to set the volume of sounds associated with Creative gadgets and devices.
Impacts 	Used to set the volume of impact sounds.
Vehicles 	Used to set the volume of vehicle sounds (except for engine sounds).
Vehicle Engines 	Used to set the volume of vehicle engines.
Weapons 	Used to set the volume of weapons.

If you have a control bus mix set on the Audio Mixer device in UEFN, the Bus setting on the device in Creative becomes deactivated. While editing the island in Creative, you will still see the Bus option and you can select a bus, but this will not actually have an effect.
Registering Players

You can register and unregister players to the Audio Mixer device, which allows you to choose who should hear the mix that the Audio Mixer controls. Registering or unregistering players is done using direct event binding. See the Direct Event Binding section for more information.

Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system, but in the near future all islands that are still using the channels system will automatically be converted, which may break your islands.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

When the Baller Spawner device receives a signal on a channel, it can be enabled or disabled, can spawn or destroy a vehicle, and assign a driver. It can transmit a signal on a channel when a player enters or exits the vehicle, and when the vehicle is spawned or destroyed.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.
Option 	Value 	Description
Assigns Driver When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	When the device receives a signal on the selected channel, it sets the instigatingplayer as the spawned vehicle's driver.
Respawn Vehicle When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	When the device receives a signal on the selected channel, it spawns a new vehicle. The existing vehicle is destroyed when a new vehicle spawns.
Destroy Vehicle When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	When the device receives a signal on the selected channel, the existing spawned vehicle is destroyed.
Enable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	When a signal is received on the selected channel, the Baller spawner is enabled.
Disable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	When a signal is received on the selected channel, the Baller spawner is disabled.
Refill Energy When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	When a signal is received on the selected channel, it refills the energy of the spawned vehicle.
Transmitters

Transmitters send a signal on the selected channel when triggered.
Option 	Value 	Description
When Player Enters Vehicle Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	Transmits a signal on the selected channel when a player enters the spawned vehicle.
When Player Exits Vehicle Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	Transmits a signal on the selected channel when a player exits the spawned vehicle.

When Vehicle Is Out Of Energy Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	Transmits a signal on the selected channel when a vehicle runs out of energy.
Upgrade Devices

The upgrade device conversion includes a number of improvements:

    Updated UX across all devices.
    Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, the device conversion is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you opt to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Before opting in to the updated devices, you should first create a backup of your island. Using the backup island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you’re satisfied,, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Upgrade Devices > Convert and Reload.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. Your island automatically reloads with the Upgrade Devices. You’ll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island.

Below are the following changes made to the device options:
New Option 	New Value 	Description 	Replaced Option
Enable Respawn 	On, Off 	Determines if the vehicle will respawn after being destroyed. If set to Off, the following option will be hidden: Respawn time. 	New option that enhances other respawn options.
Activating Team 	Any, Pick a Team 	The team this device belongs to. 	This option replaces Owning Team.
Allowed Class 	All, No, Any, Pick a Class 	The chosen class will be used to determine the Affects Class effect. [INCLUDE#class] 	This option replaces Selected Class.
Use Random Starting Energy 	No, Yes 	Spawn the vehicle with a percentage of health between 25% and 80%. If set to Yes, the following option is hidden: Starting Energy. 	This option replaces Has Infinite Energy.
Vehicle Indestructible 	Off, On 	Determines if the vehicle can be destroyed by damage. If set to Yes, the following option is hidden: Vehicle Health. 	This is a new option that enhahnces the Vehicle Health option.
Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, making your workflow more intuitive, and giving you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations inherent in the channel communication system because the devices communicate directly instead of on channels. You no longer have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit or preplanning your channel allocation when designing an island.

When you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions set in the original carry over to the copies.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Event System > Convert.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. The Direct Event Binding System is automatically added to your devices.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.
Functions

Direct event binding uses functions as receivers. A function listens for one device's event to tell another device to perform a function.
Option 	Value 	Description
Enable When Receiving From 	Add 	Enable the vehicle spawner, allowing it to spawn vehicles.
Disable When Receiving From 	Add 	Disable the vehicle spawner, stopping it from spawning any more vehicles.
Respawn Vehicle When Receiving From 	Add 	Spawns the vehicle (destroys the existing vehicle if it still exists.)
Destroy Vehicle When Receiving From 	Add 	If the vehicle that this spawner created still exists, destroy it.

Upgraded Device Options
Converting to Upgraded Devices

The upgrade device conversion includes a number of improvements:

    Updated UX across all devices.
    Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, the device conversion is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you opt to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Before opting in to the updated devices, you should first create a backup of your island. Using the backup island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you’re satisfied,, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or make a new island.
    When you are on your island, open the My Island settings, and click the Tools tab.
    Next to Upgrade Devices click Convert and Reload.
    A warning message displays. Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm.

Your island automatically reloads with the Upgrade Devices. You'll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island.

Below are the following changes made to the device options:
New Option 	New Value 	Description 	Replaced Option
Barrier Material 	Translucent, Pick a style 	Defines the visual style of the barrier. In Create mode, the visual style is invisible if the player is close to the device. More details can be found in the Visual Styles Preview section. 	This option replaces Barrier Style.
Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system, but in the near future all islands that are still using the channels system will automatically be converted, which may break your islands.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below.

This device can create a barrier zone when it receives a signal from a selected channel.
Receivers
Option 	Value 	Description
Enable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a Channel 	Enables the device when it receives a signal from the selected channel.
Disable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a Channel 	Disables the device when it receives a signal from the selected channel.
Add Player to Ignore List When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a Channel 	Adds a player to a list of additional players that the barrier should ignore. This list is in addition to the Ignore Team and Ignore Class options.
Remove Player from Ignore List When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a Channel 	Removes a specific player from the ignore list. The player will still be ignored if they are on an ignored team or of an ignored class.
Remove All Players from Ignore List When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a Channel 	Removes all players from the ignore list. Players will still be ignored if they are on an ignored team or of an ignored class.
Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, which makes your workflow more intuitive, and gives you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations that exist in the channel communication system, because the devices communicate directly with other devices. When you're designing an island, you don't have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit, or planning out your channel allocation ahead of time.

Additionally, when you copy-paste devices you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions in the original carry over to the copies.

Each device placed will have a unique identifier assigned to it, which is needed for the events and functions to work correctly. The ID automatically assigned is a random set of numbers and letters, however, so as a best practice you should name each device individually with something that has meaning and is easily remembered.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or make a new island.
    When you are on your island, open the My Island settings, and click the Tools tab.
    Next to Event System, click Convert.
    A warning message displays. Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm.

Your island automatically reloads with the direct event binding system in place. Any devices you place will now have the Events and Functions tabs in the Customize panel, instead of Channels.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.
Functions

Direct event binding uses functions as receivers. A function listens for one device's event to tell another device to perform a function.
Option 	Select Device 	Select Event 	Description
Enable When Receiving From 	Click the arrow to display a list of available devices. 	Click the arrow to display a list of available events. 	This function enables the device when an event occurs.

Basic Storm Controller Devices

Create a single-phase storm and control its size, movement and damage.
Creative
Basic Storm Controller Devices

The Basic Storm Controller is a simplified storm device that provides a way to create a single-phase storm and control its basic behaviors.

You could use this storm as a barrier to keep players inside a specific playable area, and deal damage to player health that ignores shields when players are outside the storm circle.

There are a few key points on storms to consider when customizing for your island.

    Think of the storm circle as the eye of the hurricane. When a player is inside the circle, they are safe from storm damage.
    When you adjust the storm size, you are actually adjusting the storm circle size by controlling the initial (starting) radius and the end radius.
    Configuring the storm to move will create more randomity for the player and increase the danger.
    If you configure the ending radius to 0, everything and everyone on the island will be affected by the end of the storm!

Finding and Placing the Device

Click image to expand.

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the CREATIVE inventory screen.
    Click the DEVICES tab and scroll to select the device. You can also use the Search box or the Categories panel on the left to find your device.
    Click PLACE NOW to place immediately, or put the device in the QUICK BAR to place later.
    Press Esc to return to your island in Create mode. Use your phone tool to position the device, then left-click to place it. Press Esc to detach the device from your phone.
    Point at the device with your phone. If the CUSTOMIZE popup doesn't open immediately, move closer until it does, then press E to open the CUSTOMIZE panel.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to rename them. You can choose names that relate to each device’s purpose, so it’s easier to remember what each one does.
Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
Device Options

When the Basic Storm Controller is placed in the world initially, it generates a storm at start of game with a 50 M (meter) radius. It starts to shrink afer two minutes, then waits an additional minute before closing the storm circle. Any player inside the storm receives 10 DPS (damage each second (DPS).

You can configure this device with the following options.

Default values are bold. Values that trigger contextual filtering are italic.
Basic Options
Option 	Value 	Description
Generate Storm on Game Start 	No, Yes 	Defines whether the storm is enabled at the start of the game.
Initial Radius 	50M, Pick or enter a distance 	The initial radius for the storm, in meters.
Final Radius 	0M, Pick or enter a distance 	The radius the storm will have when it ends. If you choose 0M, it means the storm will be completely closed at the end.
Damage Level 	None, 10%, Pick or enter a percentage, Instant Elimination 	How much damage the player takes each second while inside the storm, as a percentage of their max health.
All Options (Additional)
Option 	Value 	Description
Wait Time 	2 Minutes, Pick or enter an amount 	The amount of time before the storm circle begins to shrink or grow.
Resize Time 	1 Minute, Pick or enter an amount 	The amount of time it takes for the storm to go from the Initial Radius to the Final Radius.
Delay Time 	None, Pick or enter an amount 	The amount of time before the storm appears.
Finish Behavior 	Stay, Destroy 	The behavior of the storm when it has finished changing size. Stay keeps the storm in the game until the game ends. Destroy causes the storm to disappear. If you choose Destroy an additional option displays below this one.
Destruction Delay 	Destroy Instantly, Pick or enter an amount of delay 	This option only displays if the Finish Behavior option is set to Destroy. After the storm finishes changing size, this determines how much of a delay occurs before the storm is destroyed.
Move Delay Time 	0 Seconds, Pick or enter an amount 	The amount of time before the storm circle starts to move. Storm movement is different from storm resize, and this can introduce more randomness to the match.
Move Direction 	Rotation, Random 	If the storm moves, this defines how it moves. Rotation pivots around the device's original location. Random moves the storm to a random location. If you choose Random, you also need to set the Minimal Move Distance and Maximum Move Distance options.
Minimum Move Distance 	0M, Pick or enter an amount 	The minimum amount of distance the storm circle randomly moves.
Maximum Move Distance 	0M, Pick or enter an amount 	The maximum amount of distance the storm circle randomly moves.
Move Time 	1 Minute, Pick or enter an amount 	The amount of time that the storm circle takes to move from the initial location to the final location.
Storm Sickness 	Off, On 	Determines whether Storm Sickness will affect players. If you choose On, players who take a certain amount of damage from being in the storm will get Storm Sickness. This condition causes the player to take even more damage from being in the storm.

Channels

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

When the Big Rig Spawner device receives a signal on a channel, it can be enabled or disabled, can spawn or destroy a vehicle, and assign a driver. It can transmit a signal on a channel when a player enters or exits the vehicle, and when the vehicle is spawned or destroyed.
Receivers

Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, making your workflow more intuitive, and giving you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations inherent in the channel communication system because the devices communicate directly instead of on channels. You no longer have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit or preplanning your channel allocation when designing an island.

When you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions set in the original carry over to the copies.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Event System > Convert.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. The Direct Event Binding System is automatically added to your devices.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.
Functions

Direct event binding uses functions as receivers. A function listens for one device's event to tell another device to perform a function.
Option 	Value 	Description
Set Text Hidden When Receiving From 	Add 	Sets the text as hidden.
Set text Visible When Receiving From 	Add 	Sets the text as visible.
Update Display When Receiving Text Data When Receiving From 	Add 	Sets the billboard to display text that has been updated from another source.

Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system, but in the near future all islands that are still using the channels system will automatically be converted, which may break your islands.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

When the Boat Spawner device receives a signal on a channel, it can be enabled or disabled, can spawn or destroy a vehicle, and assign a driver. It can transmit a signal on a channel when a player enters or exits the vehicle, and when the vehicle is spawned or destroyed.

Upgrade Devices

The upgrade device conversion includes a number of improvements:

    Updated UX across all devices.
    Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, the device conversion is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you opt to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Before opting in to the updated devices, you should first create a backup of your island. Using the backup island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you’re satisfied,, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Upgrade Devices > Convert and Reload.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. Your island automatically reloads with the Upgrade Devices. You’ll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island.

Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, which makes your workflow more intuitive, and gives you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations that exist in the channel communication system, because the devices communicate directly with other devices. When you're designing an island, you don't have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit, or planning out your channel allocation ahead of time.

Additionally, when you copy-paste devices you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions in the original carry over to the copies.

Each device placed will have a unique identifier assigned to it, which is needed for the events and functions to work correctly. The ID automatically assigned is a random set of numbers and letters, however, so as a best practice you should name each device individually with something that has meaning and is easily remembered.

Below are the direct event binding options for all bouncers in the Bouncer Gallery.
Functions

DIRECT EVENT BINDING SYSTEM

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, making your workflow more intuitive, and giving you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations inherent in the channel communication system because the devices communicate directly instead of on channels. You no longer have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit or preplanning your channel allocation when designing an island.

When you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions set in the original carry over to the copies.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Event System > Convert.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. The Direct Event Binding System is automatically added to your devices.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.
Functions

Direct event binding uses functions as receivers. A function listens for one device's event to tell another device to perform a function.
Option 	Value 	Description
Enable When Receiving From 	Add 	Enable the bouncer.
Disable When Receveing From 	Add 	Disable the bouncer.
Events

Direct event binding uses events as transmitters. An event tells another device to perform a function.
Option 	Value 	Description
On Bounced On Send Event To 	Add 	When player is bounced by device.
On Heal Effect Starts Send Event To 	Add 	When player is healed by device.
On Heal Effect Stops Send Event To 	Add “ When heal effect stops. 	 

Button Devices

Use buttons to trigger other devices on your island.
Creative
Button Devices

You can use a Button device to activate other devices. In its default state, the button does nothing, but when configured to work with another device, the button can transmit a signal to another device when a player interacts with it.
Finding and Placing the Device

Click image to enlarge.

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the CREATIVE inventory screen.
    Click the DEVICES tab and scroll to select the device. You can also use the Search box or the Categories panel on the left to find your device.

Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system, but in the near future all islands that are still using the channels system will automatically be converted, which may break your islands.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This devce can transmit a signal on a channel when interacted with, and can be enabled or disabled when receiving a signal on a channel.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.
Receiver Options 	Value 	Description
Enable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	Enables the device when it receives a signal from the selected channel.
Disable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	Disables the device when it receives a signal from the selected channel.

Here’s an overview of how devices communicate in this Design Example:
Device A 	Function 	Device B 	Event 	Explanation

LockDevice Lock
	Open 	

Button Button
	On Interact Send Event To 	When the player interacts with the Button, the door that the Lock is attached to will open.

You now have the basic functionality for players interacting with props using the Button.

There are many ways to set up interactive props using the Button device. This device, when invisible, has a highly customizable area to expand interaction coverage, and can be used both narratively and for immersion, or for basic gameplay. HUD Messages can play in response to player interaction, Teleporters can be activated, or Billboards rendered visible, providing a lot of flexibility for your game design.
Team Buttons

You can also place Buttons that can only be activated by specific teams.

Devices used:

    2 x Buttons
    2 x Class Selectors
    2 x HUD Messages

    Place a Button for Team 1. Customize it to the following settings:
    Team Button 1
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Interact Time 	3.0 Seconds 	Time needed to interact with the Button before it activates.
    Activating Team 	Team 1 	Only members of Team 1 can interact with this Button.
    Trigger Sound 	Disabled 	No sound effects play when the Button is activated.

    Duplicate the Button and place a second one adjacent. Change the Activating Team setting on the second Button to Team 2.

    Near the Button, place a Class Selector. Customize it to the following settings:
    Class Selector 1
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Team To Switch To 	Team 1 	When activated, it will switch the player to this team.
    Time To Switch 	Instant 	Delay between entering the Class Selector and switching.

    Copy the Class Selector, and place it near the second button. Change the Team to Switch To setting on the second Class Selector to Team 2.

    Anywhere on the level, place a HUD Message. Customize it to the following settings:
    HUD Device 1
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Message 	Team 1 Button activated! 	The message displayed when the Team 1 Button is activated successfully.
    Time From Round Start 	Off 	The message is not automatically played after the start of the round.
    Message Priority 	Critical 	The message will overwrite any other HUD Message that is already up.
    Placement 	Top Center 	The location on the HUD where the message shows up when the device is activated.

    Copy the HUD Message device, then place a second down adjacent. Change the Message setting on the second HUD Device to Team 2 Button Activated!

    Set the Team 1 Button’s direct event bindings to the following:
    Button Events
    Function 	Device 	Event 	Description
    On Interact Send Event To 	Team1HUDMessage 	Show 	When the player interacts with the Button, the corresponding HUD Message will appear.

    Repeat step 7 with the Team 2 Button and corresponding HUD Device.

Here’s an overview of how devices communicate in this Design Example:
Device A 	Function 	Device B 	Event 	Explanation

Team1HUDMessage HUD Message
	Show 	

Team1Button Button
	On Interact Send Event To 	When the player interacts with the Button, the corresponding HUD Message will appear.

Team2HUDMessage HUD Message
	Show 	

Team2Button Button
	On Interact Send Event To 	When the player interacts with the Button, the corresponding HUD Message will appear.

You now have the basic structure for using team-restricted Buttons to communicate.

Restricting the Buttons to specific classes or teams is a way to create avenues that are gated behind specific individuals or teams. Doors can be locked except when a Button is pressed by a team member, certain classes can cause active defenses to appear, such as hostile sentries, or cause temporary walls and other shifted geometry to change the dynamics of the map in response to gameplay. They can also be used for teleporting to new areas, or equipping new, location-optimized loadouts.

UPGRADE DEVICES

The upgrade device conversion includes a number of improvements: Updated UX across all devices. Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options. Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior. Completely new functionality has been added to some devices. All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, the device conversion is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you opt to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Before opting in to the updated devices, you should first create a backup of your island. Using the backup island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you’re satisfied,, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Upgrade Devices > Convert and Reload.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. Your island automatically reloads with the Upgrade Devices. You’ll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island.

Below are the following changes made to the device options:
New Option 	New Value 	Description 	Replaced Option
Enabled During Phase 	Always, None, Pre-Game Only, Gameplay Only 	Determines the game phases during which the device will be enabled. Pre-Game includes all phases prior to the Game starting (the waiting for players lobby on Featured Islands and the Game Start Countdown). 	Updated values
DIRECT EVENT BINDING SYSTEM

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, making your workflow more intuitive, and giving you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations inherent in the channel communication system because the devices communicate directly instead of on channels. You no longer have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit or preplanning your channel allocation when designing an island.

When you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions set in the original carry over to the copies.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Event System > Convert.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. The Direct Event Binding System is automatically added to your devices.

Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system, but in the near future all islands that are still using the channels system will automatically be converted, which may break your islands.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.

UPGRADE DEVICES

The upgrade device conversion includes a number of improvements: Updated UX across all devices. Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options. Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior. Completely new functionality has been added to some devices. All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, the device conversion is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you opt to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Before opting in to the updated devices, you should first create a backup of your island. Using the backup island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you’re satisfied,, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Upgrade Devices > Convert and Reload.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. Your island automatically reloads with the Upgrade Devices. You’ll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island.

Below are the following changes made to the device options:
New Option 	New Value 	Description 	Replaced Option
Enabled During Phase 	Always, None, Pre-Game Only, Gameplay Only 	Determines the game phases during which the device will be enabled. Pre-Game includes all phases prior to the Game starting (the waiting for players lobby on Featured Islands and the Game Start Countdown). 	Updated values
Enable Respawn 	On, Off 	Determines if the vehicle will respawn after being destroyed. 	New option that enhances other respawn options.
Activating Team 	Any, Pick a Team 	The team this device belongs to. 	This option replaces Owning Team.

Supports Wraps 	On, Off 	Determines whether players can use wraps on the cannon. 	Updated values
Vehicle Indestructible 	Off, On 	Determines if the vehicle can be destroyed by damage. 	This is a new option that enhances the vehicle’s health options.
Destroy When Stuck Under Water 	On, Off 	Determines if the vehicle will destroy itself when it’s stuck u nder water. 	This is a new optiont hat enhances the Water Destruction Time option.
Water Destruction Timer 	Pick a time 	When the vehicle becomes too deep in water to drive, destroy it after the set amount of time has passed. 	This option replaces the Water Destruction Delay option.
DIRECT EVENT BINDING SYSTEM

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, making your workflow more intuitive, and giving you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations inherent in the channel communication system because the devices communicate directly instead of on channels. You no longer have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit or preplanning your channel allocation when designing an island.

When you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions set in the original carry over to the copies.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Event System > Convert.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. The Direct Event Binding System is automatically added to your devices.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.
Functions

Direct event binding uses functions as receivers. A function listens for one device's event to tell another device to perform a function.
Option 	Value 	Description
Enable When Receiving From 	Add 	Enable the vehicle spawner, allowing it to spawn vehicles.
Disable When Receveing From 	Add 	Disable the vehicle spawner, stopping it from spawning any more vehicles.
Respawn Vehicle When Receiving From 	Add 	Spawns the vehicle (destroys the existing vehicle if it still exists.)
Destroy Vehicle When Receiving From 	Add 	If the vehicle that this spawner created still exists, destroy it.
Assigns Driver When Receiving From 	Add 	Seats the player that instigated the message as the spawned vehicle’s driver.
Events

Direct event binding uses events as transmitters. An event tells another device to perform a function.
Option 	Value 	Description
On Player Enters the Vehicle Send Event To 	Add 	A player enters the spawned vehicle.
On Player Exits the Vehicle Send Event To 	Add 	A player exits the spawned vehicle.
On Vehicle Spawns Send Event To 	Add 	A vehicle spawns or respawns.
On Vehicle Is Destroyed Send Event To 	Add 	The spawned vehicle is destroyed.

Capture Area Devices

Use the Capture Area device to create a zone for item drop-off or point-capture objectives.
Creative
Capture Area Devices

Fortnite Creative is converting many devices in the Fortnite Creative toolset to improve user experience across devices. These improvements include:

    A Color Picker with swatches
    An Icon Picker with thumbnails of icons
    Direct entry for numeric values
    More options for better device control and customization

Some devices even have new options for increased functionality!

Currently, the upgraded devices are available in a public beta for you to try. You can use the upgraded devices with both existing islands and new experiences. To learn how to implement the changes, refer to the Converting to Upgraded Devices section.

The Capture Area device is a zone that can trigger effects once players enter it. It can be set up to be capturable by a team, to provide a score while held, or to require a specific item as a drop-off.

The main form of interaction with the capture area is for a player to step inside the zone. It can also trigger based on players dropping an item in the zone if you set the options to do that.

Depending on the options you customize, you can cause events to occur based on whether players step inside or if they stay inside for a certain length of time. There are several ways you can use the Capture Area:

    The capture area can be used as an item capture device, such as for Capture the Flag games. When you drop an item onto the device in Create mode, the item can be set to require players to interact with this device.
    The capture area can hold one item. If an item is held, the Item Filter option determines whether players need the item in question to interact with the device. You can drop a new item to replace the one currently in the device.
    The capture area can be used as a periodic scoring device. While within the area, players can gain a certain amount of score for every defined time period.
    The capture area can be used as a control point that is owned by a team and capturable by other teams. You can set how control of the area is gained and lost by teams.

Optionally, the capture area can have a floating HUD marker that shows players where the Capture Area is. This can display the Capture Area's current status, such as its captured percentage, its letter designation (if it has one), and the team that owns the Capture Area.

The device has a pulse effect when it is captured or interacted with, and the device shows the current capture percentage. When players start to capture an area, an effect will display on the players that are on the capturing team.
Finding and Placing the Device

Click image to enlarge.

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the CREATIVE inventory screen.
    Click the DEVICES tab and scroll to select the device. You can also use the Search box or the Categories panel on the left to find your device.
    Click PLACE NOW to place immediately, or put the device in the QUICK BAR to place later.
    Press the Esc key to return to your island in Create mode. Use your phone tool to position the device, then left-click to place it. Press the Esc key to detach the device from your phone.
    Point at the device with your phone. If the CUSTOMIZE popup doesn’t open immediately, move closer until it does, then press E to open the CUSTOMIZE panel.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to rename them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.

Upgraded Device Options
Converting to Upgraded Devices

The upgraded devices include a number of improvements:

    Updated UX across all devices.
    Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, converting to the upgraded devices is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you choose to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Once you decide to convert an island, you cannot undo the conversion. Therefore, if you want to convert an island to the upgraded devices, you should backup your island and then duplicate it. Using the duplicate island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you're satisfied, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Open the My Island settings, and click the Tools tab. Next to Upgrade Devices click Convert and Reload.
    A warning message displays. Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm.

Your island automatically reloads. You'll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island. Any placed devices that were on the island before conversion will now be the upgraded version, and any new devices you place will be the upgraded version.

Below are the following changes made to the device options:

Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system. However in the near future all new islands will use the new direct event binding system by default.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below, or the Direct Event Binding page.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

The capture area device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.

Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, which makes your workflow more intuitive, and gives you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations that exist in the channel communication system, because the devices communicate directly with other devices. When you're designing an island, you don't have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit, or planning out your channel allocation ahead of time.

Additionally, when you copy-paste devices you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions in the original carry over to the copies.

Each device placed will have a unique identifier assigned to it, which is needed for the events and functions to work correctly. The ID automatically assigned is a random set of numbers and letters, however, so as a best practice you should name each device individually with something that has meaning and is easily remembered.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Open the My Island settings, and click the Tools tab. Next to Event System, click Convert.
    A warning message displays. Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm.

Your island automatically reloads with the direct event binding system in place. Any devices you place will now have the Events and Functions tabs in the Customization panel, instead of Channels.

Below are the Functions and Events options for this device.
Functions

Capture Item Spawner Devices

Spawn and track a single item as your game objective.
Creative
Capture Item Spawner Devices

The Capture Item Spawner is a special type of item spawner that will only spawn a single item.

With this device, you can restrict interaction with that item to a single team, send messages to players based on the state of the item, and transmit signals to other devices based on the state of the item. In this way, you can use an item as an objective.

The Capture Item Spawner holds only one item. Dropping a new item will replace the one currently in the device.

The device has a pulse effect when it is captured or interacted with, and shows current capture percentage on the capture area material. When starting to capture an area, an effect will play on the players that are capturing.
Finding and Placing the Device

Click image to enlarge.

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the CREATIVE inventory screen.
    Click the DEVICES tab and scroll to select the device. You can also use the Search box or the Categories panel on the left to find your device.
    Click PLACE NOW to place immediately, or put the device in the QUICK BAR to place later.
    Press Esc to return to your island in Create mode. Use your phone tool to position the device, then left-click to place it. Press Esc to detach the device from your phone.
    Point at the device with your phone. If the CUSTOMIZE popup doesn’t open immediately, move closer until it does, then press E to open the CUSTOMIZE panel.

Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate. However it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, any values that trigger contextual filtering are in italic. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
Device Options

In its default state, the Capture Item Spawner has no interaction. You need to place an item on the device before it can be used.

Once an item has been placed, it will spawn at the start of the game and relay messages to players when the item is picked up, dropped, or captured by a capture area.

You can configure this device with the following options.

Default values are bold. Values that trigger contextual filtering are italic.
Basic Options
Option 	Value 	Description
Friendly Team 	All, Pick a team 	The team that owns the area at the start of the game. Can be used to determine who can interact with it (only friendlies, or only enemies), and determines what messages are displayed if capture areas are enabled.
Captured By 	Friendly Team, Hostile Teams 	Determines whether friendly teams need to pick up the item, or whether enemies need to pick it up.
Accent Color Type 	Team Color, Direct Color 	Determines how the device should be colored.
Accent Color 	Aqua, Pick a color 	Changes the device color to a specific color preset.
Return Dropped Items 	Instantly, Never, Pick an amount of time 	If the item is dropped, it returns to the capture area after this defined amount of time.
Play Capture Sounds 	On, Off 	Determines whether the item should play sound when it is captured.
All Options (Additional)
Option 	Value 	Description
Score Value 	0, Pick a score amount 	When capturing the item, a player gains this much score.
Show Capture Messages 	On, Off 	Prints messages to the chat when the item is dropped, captured, picked up, or returned.
Enabled At Game Start 	Enabled, Disabled 	Determines whether the spawner is enabled at the start of the game. A disabled area is powered down, and will not spawn items (with the item despawn) if it is still attached to the spawner. If the item has been picked up or dropped somewhere, it will not despawn.
Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system, but in the near future all islands that are still using the channels system will automatically be converted, which may break your islands.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that can enable or disable it when receiving a signal over a channel. When the item is interacted with and Show Capture Messages is enabled, the device transmits a message to the chat telling everyone in the game what interaction occurred and which player caused it.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.
Option 	Value 	Description
Enabled When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel 	When enabling, the item will spawn if it doesn't already exist.
Disabled When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel 	When disabled, if the item is still attached to the spawner, it will despawn. If someone has the item, it will not respawn when next returned.
Transmitters

Transmitters send a signal on the selected channel when triggered.
Option 	Value 	Description
When Item Picked Up Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick a channel 	Sends a signal on the defined channel when the item is picked up. The player picking up the item is the instigator.
When Item Dropped Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick a channel 	Sends a message on the defined channel when the item is dropped. The player dropping the item is the instigator.
When Item Returned Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick a channel 	Sends a message on the defined channel when the item is returned. There is no instigator of the message.
When Item Captured Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick a channel 	Sends a message on the defined channel when the item is captured. The player capturing the item is the instigator.

DIRECT EVENT BINDING SYSTEM

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, making your workflow more intuitive, and giving you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations inherent in the channel communication system because the devices communicate directly instead of on channels. You no longer have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit or preplanning your channel allocation when designing an island.

When you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions set in the original carry over to the copies.

To convert your island, follow these steps: Select an existing island or a new island. Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.) Select My Island > Tools > Event System > Convert. Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. The Direct Event Binding System is automatically added to your devices.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.
Functions

Direct event binding uses functions as receivers. A function listens for one device's event to tell another device to perform a function.
Option 	Value 	Description
Enable When Receiving From 	Add 	Enable the button.
Disable When Receveing From 	Add 	Disable the button.
Events

Direct event binding uses events as transmitters. An event tells another device to perform a function.

Channel Devices

Use this device to simplify the connections between your devices.
Creative
Channel Devices

The Channel device is a simple relay, with only one event and one function. It works much like a Trigger device, but it is easier to connect multiple devices to one Channel device. When you have complex connections between many devices on your island, using a Channel device instead of multiple Triggers could simplify your setup.

Here are some ways you can use the Channel device:

    Simplify connections between one group of many devices and another group of many devices.

    Swap devices connected to the Channel device in and out to test different game mechanics for your island, or test multiple player actions.

    Replicate the previous channel system even if your island is converted to direct event binding.

Finding and Placing the Device

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the CREATIVE inventory screen.

    Click the DEVICES tab. You can scroll to select the device, use the Search box to look up the device by name, or the Categories in the panel on the left.

    Click PLACE NOW to place immediately, or put the device in the QUICK BAR to place later.

    Press Esc to return to your island in Create mode. Use your phone to position the device, then click to place it. Press Esc to detach the device from your phone.

    Point at the device with your phone. If the CUSTOMIZE popup doesn't open immediately, move closer until it does, then press E to open the Customize panel.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to rename them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
Device Options

You can configure this device with the following options.

Show Debug Message 	Off, On 	Shows a debug message for non-published islands when the device is channeling an event. The debug message will display in the message feed.
Upgraded Device Options
Converting to Upgraded Devices

The upgraded devices include a number of improvements:

    There's an updated UX across all devices.
    Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout, and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, the device conversion is optional, but will be the default for devices in the near future.

Once you decide to convert an island, you cannot undo the conversion. Therefore, if you want to convert an island to the upgraded devices, you should backup your island and then duplicate it.

Using the duplicate island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you're satisfied, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or make a new island.

    When you are on your island, open the My Island settings, and click the Tools tab.

    Next to Upgrade Devices click Convert and Reload.

    A warning message displays. Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm.

Your island automatically reloads. You'll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island. Any devices you placed on the island before conversion will now be the upgraded version, and any new devices you place will be the upgraded version.

Below are the device options for the upgraded version.
Basic Options
Option 	Value 	Description
Show Debug Message 	Off, On 	Shows a debug message for non-published islands when channeling an event. Will show the message in the message feed.

Additionally, when you copy-paste devices you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions in the original carry over to the copies.

Each device placed will have a unique identifier assigned to it, which is needed for the events and functions to work correctly. The ID automatically assigned is a random set of numbers and letters, however, so as a best practice you should name each device individually with something that has meaning and is easily remembered.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or make a new island.

    When you are on your island, open the My Island settings, and click the Tools tab.

    Next to Event System, click Convert.

Creative
Character Device Controller Devices

Fortnite Creative is converting many devices in the Fortnite Creative toolset to improve user experience across devices. These improvements include things like a better way for selecting colors or numeric values, more options for better device control and customization, and, for some devices, new functionality!

Currently, a public beta version of the upgraded devices is available for you to try. You can opt into using the beta toolset with both existing islands and new experiences. To learn how to implement the changes, refer to the Upgrade Devices section at the bottom of the document.

Character Device Controllers can change a group of Character devices to have the same outfit, pose, emote and idle animation. Set a number of Character devices to the same Character Slot (0-19), then associate the Character Device Controller with that slot. Each Character Device Controller can control a different group, so you can create multiple groups of Character devices with each group looking or acting in a different way.

You can also use multiple Character Device Controllers with one Character device if you want the Character to look different or perform different emotes depending on what the player does or in response to events in the game.

Some devices have a limit on how many of that device can be placed on an island. This is indepdendent of how much memory the device uses. You can only place 20 Character Devices on an island.

Design Examples

Here is an example of how you can use the Character Device Controller device.
Emoting Character Devices

The Character Device Controller is used in conjunction with a Character Device in a variety of ways. In this example, we will animate some characters and change their appearance by way of using the Character Device Controller and channels.

To set up this example we will need the following devices:

1x Character Device

1x Character Device Controllers

2x Switch Devices

In this example, we use Switch Devices to signal channels, but there are many different ways to signal a channel that can be combined with the Character Device Controllers.
Character Device Options

The first thing we need to do is place a Character Device and enter the following settings.

    Character: Jonesy
    Character Slot: 1

These settings turn the Character Device into Jonesy and assign a character slot to 1. Any Character Device Controller assigned to the same slot will control any Character Devices assigned to slot 1.
Character Device Controller options

Next, we will set up the Character Device Controller. The controller is set to character slot 1 to match the Character Device. Any channels that are signaled on the Character Device Controller will control our Character Device that is also set to slot 1.

    Character: Ramirez
    Pose: Finger Guns
    Animated Idle: Cheer
    Character Slot: 1
    Change Character Appearance When Receiving From: Channel 9
    Perform Emote On Character When Receiving From: Channel 10
    Change Character Pose When Receiving From: Channel 11
    Change Character Idle When Receiving From: Channel 12

What we are going to do is set up a couple Switche Devices that will signal the different channels in the Character Device Controller.
First Switch Device Options

For the first Switch Device, set the following options.

    Device Model: Antique Lever
    When Turned On Transmit On: Channel 9
    When Turned Off Transmit On: Channel 10

Second Switch Device Options

For the second Switch Device, set the following options.

    Device Model: Antique Lever
    When Turned On Transmit On: Channel 11
    When Turned Off Transmit On: Channel 12

The two switches will signal channels that the Character Device Controller is listening to, which will affect the Character Device in slot 1. Now, whenever a switch is activated different things happen to our Character.

Any device that can send signals to a channel can be combined with a Character Device Controller to manipulate the Character Device. We can combine multiple Character Device Controllers all controlling the same character slot to make some complicated and interesting animations for a single Character Device.

Creative
Character Devices

Fortnite Creative is converting many devices in the Fortnite Creative toolset to improve user experience across devices. These improvements include things like a better way for selecting colors or numeric values, more options for better device control and customization, and, for some devices, new functionality!

Currently, a public beta version of the upgraded devices is available for you to try. You can opt into using the beta toolset with both existing islands and new experiences. To learn how to implement the changes, refer to the Upgrade Devices section at the bottom of the document.

A Character is a mannequin you can use to display characters and back bling, or to perform emotes. You can use it as an interactable dummy in your game, tying its appearance or behavior to actions by the player or events caused by other devices.

Some devices have a limit on how many of that device can be placed on an island. This is independent of how much memory the device uses. You can only place 20 Character Devices on an island.
Finding and Placing the Device

Click image to enlarge.

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the CREATIVE inventory screen.

    Click the DEVICES tab. You can scroll to select the device, use the Search box to look up the device by name, or check the Categories in the panel on the left.

    Click PLACE NOW to place immediately, or put the device in the QUICK BAR to place later.

    Press Esc to return to your island in Create mode. Use your phone to position the device, then click to place it. Press Esc to detach the device from your phone tool.

    Point at the device with your phone. If the CUSTOMIZE popup doesn't open immediately, move closer until it does, then press E to open the Customize panel.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to rename them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.

Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system, but in the near future all islands that are still using the channels system will automatically be converted, which may break your islands.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.
Option 	Value 	Description
Enable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel 	Enables the device when it receives a signal on the selected channel.
Disable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel 	Disables the device when it receives a signal on the selected channel.
Turn On Visibility When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel 	The Character becomes visible when the device receives a signal on the selected channel.
Turn Off Visibility When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel 	The Character becomes invisible when the device receives a signal on the selected channel.
Play Emote When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel 	When the device receives a signal on the selected channel, the Character performs the emote selected in the Emote option.
Transmitters

Transmitters send a signal on the selected channel when triggered.
Option 	Value 	Description
When Interacted With Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick a channel 	When a player interacts with the Character, the device transmits a signal on the selected channel.
Upgrade Devices

The upgrade device conversion includes a number of improvements:

    Updated UX across all devices.
    Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, the device conversion is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you opt to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Before opting in to the updated devices, you should first create a backup of your island. Using the backup island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you’re satisfied,, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Upgrade Devices > Convert and Reload.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. Your island automatically reloads with the Upgrade Devices. You’ll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island.

Below are the following changes made to the device options:
New Option 	New Value 	Description 	Replaced Option
Use Animated Idle 	Off, On 	When Use Animated Idle is set to On, this determines the animation the device performs when it is idle. 	Updated values
Idle (Pose) 	Stand Tall, Pick a pose 	When this device is triggered, it sets all associated Character devices to this pose. 	Updated values
Interact Type 	Do Not Interact 	Can the player interact with this character type? If so, it will transmit on the definfed channel. 	Updated values

Direct Event Binding System Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, making your workflow more intuitive, and giving you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations inherent in the channel communication system because the devices communicate directly instead of on channels. You no longer have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit or preplanning your channel allocation when designing an island.

When you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions set in the original carry over to the copies.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Event System > Convert.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. The Direct Event Binding System is automatically added to your devices.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.

Creative
Chiller Devices

A Chiller is a type of trap you can use to freeze a player's feet in a block of ice.

If a player triggers the Chiller trap, their feet are encased in ice for a short time. This trap adds a status effect to the triggering player. While the ice is on their feet, they will skate around and it will be hard for them to stop or change direction.

Vehicles driven over the Chiller will experience a similar effect, shown by wheels turning white and leaving a particle trail. This effect is produced every 2 seconds as long as a player or vehicle is contacting the Chiller device, and lasts 15 seconds.

You can attach a Chiller trap to walls and floors.

This trap device is not customizable.

Class Designer Devices

Fortnite Creative is converting many devices in the Fortnite Creative toolset to improve user experience across devices. These improvements include things like a better way for selecting colors or numeric values, more options for better device control and customization, and, for some devices, new functionality!

Currently, a public beta version of the upgraded devices is available for you to try. You can opt into using the beta toolset with both existing islands and new experiences. To learn how to implement the changes, refer to the Upgrade Devices section at the bottom of the document.

The Class Designer device is used in conjunction with the Class Selector device to make it easy to create class-based gameplay. The Class Designer gives you a way to define a custom class with an initial set of attributes and an inventory loadout.

Each device is used to design one custom class. To define the inventory loadout for this class, drop items onto the device to register them for that class.

The Class Identifier is used by:

    The Class Selector device
    The Team Settings & Inventory device
    My Island > Game settings

There is a hierarchy of setting overrides, described as follows:

    My Island settings are the baseline.
    Team Settings & Inventory overrides My Island settings if there is a specific value set in the device.
    Class Designer overrides both Team Settings & Inventory and My Island, if there is a specific value set in the device that differs from the My Island or Team Settings & Inventory values.

Refer to the following pages for more information on the My Island settings:

    My Island Game Tab

Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate. However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering.

To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.

Channels

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

The capture area device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.
Option 	Value 	Description
Show In UI When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	Enables this Class Designer for display in the Class Selector UI when it receives a signal on the selected channel.

Upgrade Devices

The upgrade device conversion includes a number of improvements:

    Updated UX across all devices.
    Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, the device conversion is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you opt to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Before opting in to the updated devices, you should first create a backup of your island. Using the backup island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you’re satisfied,, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Upgrade Devices > Convert and Reload.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. Your island automatically reloads with the Upgrade Devices. You’ll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island.

Below are the following changes made to the device options:
New Option 	New Value 	Description 	Replaced Option
Invincibility 	Don’t Override, On, Off 	Determines if players should spawn with invincibility. 	This is a new option that enhances the Stating Health Percentage option.
Starting Health Percentage 	Don't Override, 1% Health, 50% Health, 100% Health 	Determines how much health the player has when they spawn, as a percentage of their Max Health. If you choose Invincible, the player does not take any damage. This takes precedence over a Team Settings & Inventory device. 	This is a new option that replaces Starting Health.
Max Health 	Pick a number 	Determines the max health value players can reach during the game. 	This is a new option that works with Starting Health Percentage.
Starting Shield Percentage 	Don't Override, No Shields, 50% Shields, 100% Shields 	Determines how many shields the player has when they spawn, as a percentage of their Max Shields. This takes precedence over a Team Settings & Inventory device. 	This is a new option that replaces Starting Shields.
Max Shields 	Pick a number 	Determines the maximum shield value players can reach during the game. 	This is a new option that works with Starting Shield Percentage.
Movement Multiplier 	Don’t Override, Pick a number 	Determines the value multipled by the players base movement speed. Defaults to 1. Numbers lower than 1 will cause players to move slower, where numbers higher than 1 cause the player to move faster. 	This is a new option that works with Sprinting, Sliding, Slide Kick, and Shoulder Bashing.
Sprinting More Options 	Hide, Show 	Determines if more sprinting options are available in My Island Settings. 	This is a new option that modifies the Allow Sprinting option.
Eliminated Players Game Resources 	Don’t Override, Drop, Keep, Delete 	Determines what happens with the eliminated players game resources. 	This is a new optiont hat enhances the Eliminated Player options.

Class Selector Devices

Put those custom classes you made with Class Designer to work on your island for new kinds of gameplay.
Creative
Class Selector Devices

The Class Selector device is used in conjunction with the Class Designer device for creating class-based gameplay. Once you've set up your custom classes with the Class Designer, you can use the Class Selector to set how they'll be used in-game.

You need one device for each custom class you want to use, but you can use multiple Class Selectors. When in Play mode, a player can select or switch to a specific class by walking over the device's colored activation zone.

You can also use this device to set up Team Selection independently from Class Selection, but be aware that team switching will force the player to respawn.
Finding and Placing the Device

Click image to enlarge.

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the CREATIVE inventory screen.
    Click the GALLERIES tab and scroll to select the gallery that has your device. You can also use the Search box or the Categories panel on the left to find the gallery.
    Click OPEN then select one or more individual devices in the gallery.
    Click PLACE NOW to place immediately, or put the device in the QUICK BAR to place later.
    Press Esc to return to your island in Create mode. Use your phone tool to position the device, then left-click to place it. Press Esc to detach the device from your phone.
    Point at the device with your phone. If the CUSTOMIZE popup doesn't open immediately, move closer until it does, then press E to open the CUSTOMIZE panel.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to rename them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.

Now it's even easier to rename a device. When you open the device's Customize panel, just hover the cursor over the device name and click to select, delete or change the text.
Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
Device Options

Before you start to customize the options for the Class Selectors, make sure you've placed and customized your Class Designer devices, each with it's own Class Identifier. You will use this identifier with the Class to Switch to option here in the Class Selector. You should also consider the following.

    You have to specify a class number for this to work.

    That number must be defined in a Class Designer device.

    If the number is not defined in a Class Designer, the player will be assigned default attributes with no weapons. It does not fall back to the Default Class Identifier assigned in a Team Settings & Inventory device, or in My Island > Game settings.

You can configure this device with the following options.

Default values are bold. Values that trigger contextual filtering are italic.
Basic Options
Option 	Value 	Description
Class to Switch to 	Do Not Switch, None, Pick a class number 	Indicates which class the player will switch to, as defined by the Class Identifier in the Class Designer. If you choose None, the player will not switch their class. This is mostly used for team switching.

Class Selector UI Devices

Create a UI element that lists the classes that players can choose from.
Creative
Class Selector UI Devices

The Class Selector UI device can create both a popup dialog and a new tab on the game Map screen to display a list of classes players can choose from. You can use this class selection UI in many ways:

    Have players choose a class when they spawn at the beginning of the game, and they keep that class for the entire game.

    Allow players to choose their class when the game starts, then let them change their class when they respawn during the game.

    Decide whether a class change happens with the popup dialog or the Map screen tab, or both if they both are available.

Below are illustrations of the Class Selector UI popup dialog, and the Class Selector UI tab on the Map screen.
Class Selector UI Popup Dialog 	Class Selector UI Map Screen
Class Selector UI Popup Dialog 	Class Selector UI Map Screen

The list of classes can also provide more details about a class to the player, such as what weapon loadout or resources are granted to that class.

This device requires that you use the Class Designer device. The Class Designer, along with the Team Settings & Inventory device, can sometimes override My Island settings. This could produce unexpected results if you are not aware of how the game prioritizes these settings. The hierarchy of setting or device option overrides is as follows:

    My Island settings are the baseline for an island.

    Options in the Team Settings & Inventory device override My Island settings if there is a specific value set in the device.

    The Class Designer device overrides both Team Settings & Inventory and My Island, if there is a specific value set in the device that differs from the My Island or Team Settings & Inventory values.

    Some options in the Class Selector UI device override Class Designer options.

You can only place one instance of this device on an island.
Using the Class Selector UI

To use this device effectively, you need to use it with Class Designer devices (one Class Designer for each class you want to provide for players). First, place the Class Selector UI device, then place your Class Designer devices. Set up your Class Designers for each class you want to provide to players:

    Add a class name and description (these are Class Designer options used by the Class Selector UI device).

    Add a different class identifier for each class.

    Add whatever items, weapons and resources you want to grant each class.

    Make sure that each Class Designer has the Visible in UI option set to Yes.

There are also channel options in the Class Designer that you can use to enable or disable the class selection UI. For more information on the Class Designer device, see Class Designer Devices in the Creative documentation.
Finding and Placing the Device

Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system, but in the near future all islands that are still using the channels system will automatically be converted, which may break your islands.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, making your workflow more intuitive, and giving you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations inherent in the channel communication system because the devices communicate directly instead of on channels. You no longer have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit or preplanning your channel allocation when designing an island.

When you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions set in the original carry over to the copies.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Event System > Convert.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. The Direct Event Binding System is automatically added to your devices.

Collectibles Gallery Devices

Place themed, customizable resources for players to collect throughout gameplay.
Creative
Collectibles Gallery Devices

The Collectibles Gallery provides a variety of collectible objects that you can use as economy drivers, or mediums of exchange. You can also use these items as objectives that drive gameplay.

When used as an economy driver, these consumables can trigger item granting devices like the Item Granter when collected. Through item granting devices, you can offer usable items, weapons, or consumables like Gold whenever the collectible is picked up.

For example, whenever a Music Note from the Collectibles Gallery is consumed, it can trigger the player to collect a Boogie Bomb through the Item Granter.

You can also use the items from this gallery as a win condition through either points or item accumulation:

    Change the My Island > Game settings for either Collect Items to End or Score to End to use collectible items as gameplay objectives.

    To use the Collect Items to End setting, set the amount of items required to be collected. The first player or team to collect the required amount wins the game.

    To use the Score to End setting, set the amount of score required to end the game. Then, set a score amount for each collectible item using the Collectibles Gallery's Customize panel. The first team or player to reach the required score wins the game.

Creative
Color Changing Tile Devices

Fortnite Creative is converting many devices in the Fortnite Creative toolset to improve user experience across devices. These improvements include things like a better way for selecting colors or numeric values, more options for better device control and customization, and, for some devices, new functionality!

Currently, a public beta version of the upgraded devices is available for you to try. You can opt into using the beta toolset with both existing islands and new experiences. To learn how to implement the changes, refer to the Upgrade Devices section at the bottom of the document.

The Color Changing Tile device creates a tile that changes colors when players interact with it.

When this device is first placed, it is a neutral gray team color. When a player steps on the tile or drives any vehicle over it, the tile switches to the color of the player’s team, and remains that color until a player in another team steps on it or drives over it.

This tile can be rotated in all three axes, but traps and trick tiles cannot be attached to it.
Finding and Placing the Device

Click image to enlarge.

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the Creative inventory window.
    Click the Devices tab and scroll to select the device. You can also use the Search box or the Categories panel on the left to find your device.
    Click PLACE NOW to place immediately, or put the device in the **QUICK BAR** to place later.
    Press Esc to return to your island in Create mode. Use your phone to position the device, then left-click to place it. Press Esc to detach the device from your phone.
    Point at the device with your phone. If the CUSTOMIZE popup doesn't open immediately, move closer until it does, then press E to open the Customize panel.

Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device reference documents we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
Device Options

You can configure this device with the following options.

Default values are bold. Values that trigger contextual filtering are italic.
Basic Options

Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system, but in the near future all islands that are still using the channels system will automatically be converted, which may break your islands.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.
Option 	Value 	Description
Enable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	The device is enabled when it receives a signal from the selected channel.
Disable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	The device is disabled when it receives a signal from the selected channel.
Reset When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	The device is reset to the default team color when it receives a signal from the selected channel.
Set Team When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	When it receives a signal from the selected channel, the device sets the color to the team color of the instigating player.
Transmitters

Transmitters send a signal when triggered on a channel.
Option 	Value 	Description
When Activated Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	Transmits a signal when the device changes color.
Design Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use the Color Change Tiles.

    Color Change Minigame
    Navigation Puzzle
    Powerup Activation On Score

Color Change Minigame

Setting up a minigame where competing players run across Color Change Tiles requires no additional device functionality beyond setting up the Color Change Tiles and having multiple teams.

You will need the following devices.

    18x Color Changing Tiles

Build a 3x3 floor of Color Change Tiles, then rotate the remaining devices sideways to create walls on three sides. Customize the following settings. Setting up one tile then copying it to other locations will save time.
Color Change Tile Settings
Option 	Value 	Description
Score 	1 	The amount of score gained when capturing a tile.
Steal Score 	Yes 	Upon claiming a Color Change Tile captured by another player, the score you gain is deducted from their score.

You now have created the basic functionality for a Color Swap Tile game.

Guns, mobility items and other options can make this style of capturing areas more compelling. You can also tilt the Color Change Tiles into walls to touch them, adding to the number of total tiles to capture in the game.
Navigation Puzzle

You can also use Color Changing Tiles to build navigation puzzles. If players are moving on the normal tiles, they can keep moving without issues. If players move on to the black tiles, they are teleported to the starting point. Once players arrive at the destination green tile, the black tiles no longer affect players. Players must avoid the black tiles while trying to navigate to the green tile.

You will need the following devices.

    Multiple Color Changing Tiles
    1x Teleporter

    Create an entrance to the area for the navigation puzzle and place a Teleporter device. Customize the teleporter as described.
    Teleporter Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Teleporter Rift Visible 	No 	The teleporter rift is not visible during gameplay.
    Teleport To When Receiving From 	Channel 20 	This is the signal transmitted to reset the tiles and teleport the player back to the start when they step on one of the black tiles.

    Customize the black tiles with the following settings, then distribute them around the path. Setting up one tile then copying it to other locations will save time.
    black Tile Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Starting Team 	16 	For Team 16, the starting team color is black. This is used to color the tile.
    Time Until Reverting 	1 Second 	When touched, the tiles turn back to black after one second.
    Disable When Receiving From 	Channel 25 	When the destination green tile is reached, the black and normal Color Change Tiles are disabled.
    When Activated Transmit On 	Channel 20 	When stepped on, transmits a signal to the teleporter, sending the player back to the start. This will also reset the other Color Changing Tiles.

    Customize the normal Color Changing Tiles with the following settings and fill out the path of the maze that players will run across. Setting up one tile then copying it to other locations will save time.
    Normal Color Changing Tiles
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Disable When Receiving From 	Channel 25 	When the destination green tile is reached, these tiles are disabled.
    Reset When Receiving From 	Channel 20 	When the black tiles are triggered, all normal Color Changing Tiles are reset back to normal.

    Customize the green destination tile with the following settings.
    Destination Tile Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Starting Team 	4 	The starting color is set to green.
    Reset When Receiving From 	Channel 20 	Resets the color to Team 4 if a black tile is stepped on.
    When Activated Transmit On 	Channel 25 	When stepped on, transmits a signal to disable the black and color tiles as the game mode ends.

You have now finished the navigation puzzle design example.

For an added challenge, remove the team colors of the black tiles so they are identical, creating an iterative game where they will need to progressively explore further with a bit of random chance. You can also add in an automatic Grind powerup to make it more difficult to move around.
Powerup Activation On Score

Another option for your arena is to set the ground entirely to Color Changing Tiles and make it so when you gather a certain amount of score, it can trigger a powerup. In this design example, when you run across a sufficient number of tiles, you'll receive a Damage Amplifier.

You will need the following devices.

    9x Color Changing Tiles
    1x Attribute Trigger
    1x Score Manager
    1x Damage Amplifier Powerup

    Set up a Color Change Tile with the following settings.
    Color Changing Tiles Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Time Until Reverting 	5 Seconds 	The time it takes for a tile to return to default after being captured.
    Score 	1 	The amount of score granted per captured tile.
    Appearance 	Disco 	The physical appearance of the Color Change Tiles. This is optional.
    When Activated Transmit On 	Channel 1 	Transmits a signal for the Attribute Trigger to check each time a tile is captured and the score is incremented.

    Copy the Color Change Tile and make a 3x3 grid on the ground.

    Place the Attribute Trigger anywhere on the island. Customize the following settings.
    Attribute Trigger Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Min Player Score 	5 	The amount of score the Attribute Trigger is looking for.
    Trigger Sound 	Disabled 	Default sound effects are disabled.
    Listen to Channel 	Channel 1 	Each time a Color Change Tile is stepped on and increases the score, it transmits a signal that has the Attribute Trigger check if the score is 5.
    If All Checks Are Valid Transmit On 	Channel 2 	If the score after stepping on a tile is 5, transmits a signal on Channel 2 to award a powerup and reset the score.

    Place the Score Manager anywhere on the island. Customize the following settings.
    Score Manager Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Score Award Type 	Set 	Will set the score to 0 when triggered.
    Activate When Receiving From 	Channel 2 	Activates when the Attribute Trigger sends a signal upon reaching 5 score.

    Place the Damage Amplifier Powerup anywhere on the island. Customize the settings as follows.
    Damage Amplifier Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Time To Respawn 	Instant 	The Damage Amplifier instantly respawns when awarded.
    Ambient Audio 	Off 	The ready powerup sound effects are disabled.
    Pickup When Received From 	Channel 2 	When the Attribute Trigger detects 5 score, it sends a signal to award this powerup.

You have now set up a Color Changing Tile floor that can award powerups.

If you set your entire arena floor to this style of Color Changing Tile with a much higher score requirement, you can set bonuses to grant when they run around enough. This can add interesting dynamics to many weapon-based PvP modes. There can be tiers of rewards or mythic weapons offered, and the score is reset upon player elimination instead of when being awarded.
Upgrade Devices

The upgrade device conversion includes a number of improvements:

    Updated UX across all devices.
    Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, the device conversion is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you opt to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Before opting in to the updated devices, you should first create a backup of your island. Using the backup island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you’re satisfied,, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Upgrade Devices > Convert and Reload.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. Your island automatically reloads with the Upgrade Devices. You’ll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island.

Below are the following changes made to the device options:
New Option 	New Value 	Description 	Replaced Option
Revert Tile 	Off, On 	Whether or not the tile reverts color after an amount of time. 	This is a new option that replaces Time Until Reverting.
Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, making your workflow more intuitive, and giving you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations inherent in the channel communication system because the devices communicate directly instead of on channels. You no longer have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit or preplanning your channel allocation when designing an island.

When you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions set in the original carry over to the copies.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Event System > Convert.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. The Direct Event Binding System is automatically added to your devices.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.
Functions

Direct event binding uses functions as receivers. A function listens for one device's event to tell another device to perform a function.
Option 	Value 	Description
Enable When Receiving From 	Add 	Enables the color changing tile.
Disable When Receiving From 	Add 	Disables the color changing tile.
Reset When Receieing From 	Add 	Resets the color changing tile.
Set Team When receiving From 	Add 	Sets the color of the tile to the team of the player.
Show When Receiving From 	Add 	Makes the device visible.

Creature Manager Devices

Fortnite Creative is converting many devices in the Fortnite Creative toolset to improve user experience across devices. These improvements include things like a better way for selecting colors or numeric values, more options for better device control and customization, and, for some devices, new functionality!

Currently, a public beta version of the upgraded devices is available for you to try. You can opt into using the beta toolset with both existing islands and new experiences. To learn how to implement the changes, refer to the Upgrade Devices section at the bottom of the document.

The Creature Manager device provides a way to customize one creature type at a time. Place multiple Creature Managers for each type of creature on your island.

By customizing this device, you can control a number of options. Some examples are the type and amount of damage a creature does to players, to the score a player receives for eliminating that type of creature.

By itself, this device does nothing. To spawn creatures, pair Creature Manager devices with Creature Spawners or Creature Placers.
Finding and Placing the Device

Click to enlarge.

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the Creative inventory window.
    Click the Devices tab and scroll to select the device. You can also use the Search box or the Categories panel on the left to find your device.

Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system, but in the near future all islands that are still using the channels system will automatically be converted, which may break your islands.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.

Upgrade Devices

The upgrade device conversion includes a number of improvements:

    Updated UX across all devices.
    Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, the device conversion is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you opt to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Before opting in to the updated devices, you should first create a backup of your island. Using the backup island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you’re satisfied,, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Upgrade Devices > Convert and Reload.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. Your island automatically reloads with the Upgrade Devices. You’ll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island.

Below are the following changes made to the device options:
New Option 	New Value 	Description 	Replaced Option
Enabled on Game Start 	On, Off 	Whether or not this device is enabled when the game is started. For use in conjunction with Events and Functions. 	This option replaces Enabled at Game Start to better work with Direct Event Binding options.
Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, making your workflow more intuitive, and giving you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations inherent in the channel communication system because the devices communicate directly instead of on channels. You no longer have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit or preplanning your channel allocation when designing an island.

When you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions set in the original carry over to the copies.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Event System > Convert.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. The Direct Event Binding System is automatically added to your devices.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.

Creature Spawner Devices

Use Creature Spawner Devices to spawn enemies that can attack players.
Creative
Creature Spawner Devices

The Creature Spawner is a device that can spawn one or more creatures, of one or more types, at selected time intervals. There are settings to define when the spawner should start spawning and when it should stop. You can set whether players can see the spawner and whether they are able to destroy it.

While there isn't a limit on the number of Creature Spawners you can have on an island, there is a limit on the total number of spawned AI enemies on an island. This includes creatures, guards, and wildlife. You can only have 90 AI enemies active at a time, across all devices that spawn AI enemies. If you have a lot of Creature Spawners, or if you also have Guard or Wildlife Spawners on your island, keep track of the number of enemies each is spawning so you stay under the overall limit.

Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
Device Options

This device has some basic functionality, like type of spawner, type and number creatures spawned, how close players must get to trigger spawns, spawn range from the device, and whether creatures spawn through walls.

Additionally, there are some advanced options, like the wave timer, creature despawn details, whether the device is visible or destructible, and more spawn effect and location details.

Design Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use the Creature Spawner.

    Invisible Creature Spawner
    Limited Creature Spawns

The Creature Spawner is a very powerful device that can overcome the placement limitations of a Creature Placer to spawn an unlimited number of creatures in many different ways.

The Creature Spawner is used in conjunction with the Creature Manager. The Creature Manager is used to set the abilities of a creature type that the Creature Spawner will spawn.

The best practice is to have spawners only spawn a specific type of creature and avoid using Random Spawn. This gives much more control to the designer. Multiple creature spawners can be placed near each other to control exactly how many types and quantities of creatures each spawner will produce.
Invisible Creature Spawner

There are two types of Creature Spawners that can be selected via the spawner visibility settings.
Creature Spawner Visibility

An invisible Creature Spawner can not be destroyed directly by a player with weapon fire, while a visible spawner can have health and be destroyed by a player. This gives flexibility to the designer to create the kind of experience they are looking for.

One excellent way of using invisible Creature Spawners is in a dungeon crawl. Position invisible Creature Spawners all throughout the dungeon, and when a player comes within range or passes through a trigger, the spawner can become active and spawn any number of creatures all at once or through waves.
Limited Creature Spawns
Creature Spawner Spawn Limit

A Creature Spawner can be set to spawn a limited number of creatures with the Limit Spawned Creatures and Total Spawn Limit options. Once the number set in Total Spawn Limit is reached, the spawner will not spawn any more creatures.

If Limit Spawned Creatures is set to No**, the spawner will keep spawning creatures until it is disabled, if the spawner is invisible; or until it is destroyed, if the spawner is visible and has health.

Creative
Creepin' Cardboard Devices

The Creepin’ Cardboard device is an environmental object that players can interact with. When placed, it looks like a large cardboard box, with one of several possible random skins. In-game, players can approach the box and press E to hide inside. Press and hold E to exit the Creepin’ Cardboard device.

While hiding in the Creepin’ Cardboard device, players can move around slowly, collect weapons and consumables, and can pop up out of the box to fire weapons by holding the right mouse button to aim. However, players will need to exit the Creepin’ Cardboard to reload. Exiting a Creepin’ Cardboard device does not destroy it; players can reuse it. A Creepin’ Cardboard device is destroyed if it takes any damage when not in use.

Unlike most devices, Creepin’ Cardboard devices cannot be customized in any way, and have no options.

Additionally, when you copy-paste devices you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions in the original carry over to the copies.

Each device placed will have a unique identifier assigned to it, which is needed for the events and functions to work correctly. The ID automatically assigned is a random set of numbers and letters, however, so as a best practice you should name each device individually with something that has meaning and is easily remembered.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.

    Open the My Island settings, and click the Tools tab. Next to Event System, click Convert.

    A warning message displays. Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm.

Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, making your workflow more intuitive, and giving you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations inherent in the channel communication system because the devices communicate directly instead of on channels. You no longer have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit or preplanning your channel allocation when designing an island.

When you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions set in the original carry over to the copies.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Event System > Convert.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. The Direct Event Binding System is automatically added to your devices.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.
Functions

Direct event binding uses functions as receivers. A function listens for one device's event to tell another device to perform a function.

Damage Amplifier Powerup Devices

Fortnite Creative is converting many devices in the Fortnite Creative toolset to improve user experience across devices. These improvements include things like a better way for selecting colors or numeric values, more options for better device control and customization, and, for some devices, new functionality!

Currently, a public beta version of the upgraded devices is available for you to try. You can opt into using the beta toolset with both existing islands and new experiences. To learn how to implement the changes, refer to the Upgrade Devices section at the bottom of the document.

When a player picks up or triggers the Damage Amplifier Powerup device, their ability to deal damage to another player or NPC (non-player character) is instantly amplified. This applies to any weapon the player is using at the time pf the powerup. This is a temporary effect, and you can customize the powerup duration.

You can control which players, teams or classes can use this powerup, how much the powerup is amplified (multiplied), how long it lasts, and a number of other customizable features. You can use it to give one team an advantage — especially when playing against NPCs — or to level the playing field. It’s also a useful pickup for players in-game.

Upgrade Devices

The upgrade device conversion includes a number of improvements:

    Updated UX across all devices.
    Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, the device conversion is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you opt to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Before opting in to the updated devices, you should first create a backup of your island. Using the backup island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you’re satisfied,, you can safely convert the original island.

When you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions set in the original carry over to the copies.

Additionally, each device placed will have a unique identifier assigned to it, which is needed for the events and functions to work correctly. The ID automatically assigned is a random set of numbers and letters, however, so as a best practice it is best to name each device individually with something that has meaning and is easily remembered.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system, but in the near future all islands that are still using the channels system will automatically be converted, which may break your islands.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.
Option 	Value 	Description
Activate Skin and Emote Capture When Received From 	No Channel, Pick a channel 	Assumes the instigator’s skin and emotes on this channel.
Deactivate Skin and Emote Capture When Received From 	No Channel, Pick a channel 	Resets the skin and emote on this channel.
Activate Default Preset When Received From 	No Channel, Pick a channel 	Activates the default preset on the specified channel.
Activate Preset 2 When Received From 	No Channel, Pick a channel 	Activates preset 2 on the specified channel. Activated through Activate Preset 2 On Channel.
Activate Preset 3 When Received From 	No Channel, Pick a channel 	Activated preset 3 on the specified channel. Activated through Activate Preset 3 On Channel.
Enable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel 	Enables this device when receiving on this channel.
Disable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel 	Disables this device when receiving on this channel.
Upgrade Devices

The upgrade device conversion includes a number of improvements:

    Updated UX across all devices.
    Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, the device conversion is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you opt to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Before opting in to the updated devices, you should first create a backup of your island. Using the backup island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you’re satisfied,, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Upgrade Devices > Convert and Reload.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. Your island automatically reloads with the Upgrade Devices. You’ll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island.

Below are the following changes made to the device options:
New Option 	New Value 	Description 	Replaced Option
Enabled on Phase 	Always, None, Pre-Game Only, Gameplay Only, Create Only 	Determines the game phases during which the device will be enabled. Pre-Game includes all phases prior to the game starting. 	This option replaces the Enabled During Phase option.
Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, making your workflow more intuitive, and giving you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations inherent in the channel communication system because the devices communicate directly instead of on channels. You no longer have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit or preplanning your channel allocation when designing an island.

When you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions set in the original carry over to the copies.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Event System > Convert.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. The Direct Event Binding System is automatically added to your devices.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.
Functions

Direct event binding uses functions as receivers. A function listens for one device's event to tell another device to perform a function.
Option 	Value 	Description
Activate Skin and Emote Capture When Receiving From 	Add 	Assumes the instigator's skin and emotes.
Deactivate Skin and Emote Capture When Receiving From 	Add 	Resets the skin and emote.

Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system, but in the near future all islands that are still using the channels system will automatically be converted, which may break your islands.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.

Upgrade Devices

The upgrade device conversion includes a number of improvements:

    Updated UX across all devices.
    Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, the device conversion is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you opt to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Before opting in to the updated devices, you should first create a backup of your island. Using the backup island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you’re satisfied,, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Upgrade Devices > Convert and Reload.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. Your island automatically reloads with the Upgrade Devices. You’ll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island.

Below are the following changes made to the device options:

Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, making your workflow more intuitive, and giving you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations inherent in the channel communication system because the devices communicate directly instead of on channels. You no longer have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit or preplanning your channel allocation when designing an island.

When you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions set in the original carry over to the copies.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Event System > Convert.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. The Direct Event Binding System is automatically added to your devices.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.

You now have the functionality for basic enemy drops using the Elimination Manager.

This core functionality of the Elimination Manager is fundamental to many different game modes and has potential to create many different experiences. This example could be extended out into a full game with different enemy types, upgrade choices, waves, etc. Enemies can drop many different items, so consider making them drop consumables, new weapons, or building materials.
Drop Chance

Use the Elimination Manager drop chance functionality to hide key items in a swarm of enemies.

Devices used:

    1 x Elimination Manager
    1 x Player Spawner
    1 x Creature Spawner
    1 x Lock Device
    1 x Conditional Button

    Create a small play area with a door on one wall and a Player Spawner across the room. Keep the default settings on the Player Spawner.

    Place a Creature Spawner in the center of the room and customize it to the following settings:
    Drop Chance Creature Spawner Settings

ConditionalButton Conditional Button
	On Activated Send Event To 	When the player activates the Conditional Button with the Key, the door will open and allow them to escape.

You now have the basic functionality for a rare item drop.

This example could be easily extended by requiring more Key items for the player to escape the area or receive a reward. Different items could be dropped by different enemies, or larger enemies could have a higher chance of dropping a rare item. Explore different combinations of items, enemies, and drop chances to find a balance that feels engaging and fair.

It is often a good idea to make sure that higher-quality items are dropped less frequently than items with less power, and the drop chance setting is a great way to control this.

End Game Devices

The End Game device ends the round or game when activated.
Creative
End Game Devices

Fortnite Creative is converting many devices in the Fortnite Creative toolset to improve user experience across devices. These improvements include things like a better way for selecting colors or numeric values, more options for better device control and customization, and, for some devices, new functionality!

Currently, a public beta version of the upgraded devices is available for you to try. You can opt into using the beta toolset with both existing islands and new experiences. To learn how to implement the changes, refer to the Upgrade Devices section at the bottom of the document.

The End Game device can be set to end either the current round or the entire game, and determines which team met the conditions for the win condition. This device can be triggered by another device after receiving a signal across the same channel.
Finding and Placing the Device

Click to enlarge image.

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the Creative inventory window.

Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system, but in the near future all islands that are still using the channels system will automatically be converted, which may break your islands.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.
Option 	Value 	Description
Activate When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	Ends the Round/Game on receiving a signal from this channel.
Enable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	Enables the device on receiving a signal from the selected channel.
Disable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	Disables the device on receiving a signal from the selected channel.
Upgrade Devices

The upgrade device conversion includes a number of improvements:

    Updated UX across all devices.
    Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, the device conversion is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you opt to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Before opting in to the updated devices, you should first create a backup of your island. Using the backup island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you’re satisfied,, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Upgrade Devices > Convert and Reload.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. Your island automatically reloads with the Upgrade Devices. You’ll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island.

Below are the following changes made to the device options:
New Option 	New Value 	Description 	Replaced Option
Activating Team 	Any, Pick a team 	Determines which team can activate the device. 	This is a new option for team related games.
Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, making your workflow more intuitive, and giving you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations inherent in the channel communication system because the devices communicate directly instead of on channels. You no longer have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit or preplanning your channel allocation when designing an island.

When you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions set in the original carry over to the copies.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Event System > Convert.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. The Direct Event Binding System is automatically added to your devices.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.
Functions

Direct event binding uses functions as receivers. A function listens for one device's event to tell another device to perform a function.
Option 	Value 	Description
Activate When Receiving From 	Add 	Activates the device.
Enable When Receiving From 	Add 	Enables the device.
Disable When Receiving From 	Add 	Disables the device.

Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, making your workflow more intuitive, and giving you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations inherent in the channel communication system because the devices communicate directly instead of on channels. You no longer have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit or preplanning your channel allocation when designing an island.

When you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions set in the original carry over to the copies.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Event System > Convert.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. The Direct Event Binding System is automatically added to your devices.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.
Functions

Direct event binding uses functions as receivers. A function listens for one device's event to tell another device to perform a function.
Option 	Value 	Description
Explode When Receiving From 	Add 	The device explodes.
Turn on Visibility When Receiving From 	Add 	Makes the device visible.
Reset When Receiving From 	Add 	Resets the device.
Events

Direct event binding uses events as transmitters. An event tells another device to perform a function.
Option 	Value 	Description
On Explode Send Event To 	Add 	The device explodes.Fang Spawner Devices

Spawn cool cars on your island to give players a fast and stylish vehicle they can use to get around!
Creative
Fang Spawner Devices

Use the Fang Spawner to place any of three variants of the Fang car on your island. Choose which variant you want to use with the Vehicle Type option:

    Nitro Fang: Make each spawned vehicle have a random color, or set a specific color that is applied to all vehicles spawned from the device.

    Pizza Pit Fang: A pizza-delivery vehicle that can also be used as a getaway car.

    Thorne's Fang: A cool car for a tough boss!

The cars spawned from the Fang Spawner handle similarly to the Nitro Drifter sedan. They have:

    Better traction

    Higher acceleration, particularly in the lower gears

    Higher top speed than the basic sedan

    Ability to drift (engage handbrake to slide sideways while moving forward)

Finding and Placing the Device

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the CREATIVE inventory screen.

    Click the DEVICES tab. You can scroll to select the device, use the Search box to look up the device by name, or the Categories in the panel on the left.

    Click PLACE NOW to place immediately, or put the device in the QUICK BAR to place later.

    Press Esc to return to your island in Create mode. Use your phone to position the device, then click to place it. Press Esc to detach the device from your phone.

    Point at the device with your phone. If the CUSTOMIZE popup doesn't open immediately, move closer until it does, then press E to open the Customize panel.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to rename them. You can choose names that relate to each device’s purpose, so it’s easier to remember what each one does.
Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.

Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system, but in the near future all islands that are still using the channels system will automatically be converted, which may break your islands.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.
Option 	Value 	Description
Enable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a Channel Number 	Enables the device when it receives a signal on the selected channel.
Disable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a Channel Number 	Disables the device when it receives a signal on the selected channel.
Ignite When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a Channel Number 	Objects inside the volume are ignited when the device receives a signal on the selected channel.
Extinguish When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a Channel Number 	Objects on fire inside the volume are extinguished when the device receives a signal on the selected channel.
Upgrade Devices

The upgrade device conversion includes a number of improvements:

    Updated UX across all devices.
    Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, the device conversion is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you opt to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Before opting in to the updated devices, you should first create a backup of your island. Using the backup island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you’re satisfied,, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Upgrade Devices > Convert and Reload.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. Your island automatically reloads with the Upgrade Devices. You’ll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island.

Fortnite Creative is converting many devices in the Fortnite Creative toolset to improve user experience across devices. These improvements include things like a better way for selecting colors or numeric values, more options for better device control and customization, and, for some devices, new functionality!

Currently, a public beta version of the upgraded devices is available for you to try. You can opt into using the beta toolset with both existing islands and new experiences. To learn how to implement the changes, refer to the Upgrade Devices section at the bottom of the document.

The Fishing Zone device provides a way for creators to add various fishing elements to their games, such as:

    Fishing competitions between players
    Collecting fish as a resource
    A fun minigame with its own rewards

You can place a fishing pool in water, or you can place it in more unusual places like an artificial container or in lava. You can drop items onto the device, similar to an Item Spawner or Item Granter, so players can catch things besides fish.

Device Options

This device creates an area in the water (or in other areas) populated with fish and other items that the player can catch using a fishing pole. You can configure this device with the following options.

Default values are bold.
Basic Options
Option 	Value 	Description
Uses Allowed 	Infinite, Battle Royale, Pick a number 	Determines how many times the Fishing Zone can be used before it is disabled. If you choose Battle Royale, the device matches the uses allowed in Fortnite Battle Royale.
Pool Type 	Battle Royale, Device Inventory, Trigger Only, Fish Only 	Determines the type of fishing pool this is, and what loot can be gained from it. If you choose Device Inventory, you can drop items onto the pool to customize the loot gained from the pool. Trigger Only is used with the When Caught Transmit On option; the pool does not spawn items, instead it transmits a signal when the player catches something.
Zone FX 	FX On, FX Off 	Determines whether the zone has water visual FX.
Disable When Empty 	No, Yes 	If the pool is set to Device Inventory, determines whether the device is disabled if all items have been caught and removed.

The Pre-Game phase includes all phases before the game starts, including:

    The Waiting For Players lobby in Featured Islands
    The Game Start countdown

Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system, but in the near future all islands that are still using the channels system will automatically be converted, which may break your islands.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.
Option 	Value 	Description
Enable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel number 	Enables this device when it receives a signal from the selected channel.
Disable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel number 	Disables this device when it receives a signal from the selected channel.
Restock When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel number 	If the pool type is set to Device Inventory, all caught and removed items are returned to the device inventory when the device receives a signal on the selected channel.
Reset Uses When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel number 	Resets the number of available uses (set in the Uses Allowed option) when the device receives a signal from the selected channel.
Transmitters

Transmitters send a signal on the selected channel when triggered.
Option 	Value 	Description
When Caught Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick a channel number 	When a fish is caught, the device transmits a signal on the selected channel.
When Empty Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick a channel number 	When all items have been caught and removed, the device transmits a signal on the selected channel.
Upgrade Devices

The upgrade device conversion includes a number of improvements:

    Updated UX across all devices.
    Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, the device conversion is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you opt to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Before opting in to the updated devices, you should first create a backup of your island. Using the backup island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you’re satisfied,, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Upgrade Devices > Convert and Reload.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. Your island automatically reloads with the Upgrade Devices. You’ll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island.

Below are the following changes made to the device options:
New Option 	New Value 	Description 	Replaced Option
Usage Type 	Infinite, Battle Royale, Limited 	Determines how many times the fishing zone can be used before it disables depending on the type. If set to Limited, the following option becomes available: Number of Uses. 	Updated values
Pool Type 	Battle Royale, Device Inventory, Trigger Only, Fish Only 	Determines the type of fishing zone. If set to Device Inventory, the following options become available: Disable When Empty and Remove Caught Items. 	Updated values
Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, making your workflow more intuitive, and giving you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations inherent in the channel communication system because the devices communicate directly instead of on channels. You no longer have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit or preplanning your channel allocation when designing an island.

When you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions set in the original carry over to the copies.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Event System > Convert.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. The Direct Event Binding System is automatically added to your devices.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.
Functions

Direct event binding uses functions as receivers. A function listens for one device's event to tell another device to perform a function.

On Empty Send Event To 	Add 	When all items have been caught and removed.

Fuel Pump Devices

Place Fuel Pumps for players to refuel vehicles, or target with weapons to inflict damage on opponents.
Creative
Fuel Pump Devices

A Fuel Pump device is a way to provide a fuel source for vehicles. They can also be used to deal considerable damage to players and the environment when destroyed.

These devices can provide infinite amounts of fuel, or have a limited amount of fuel available.

You can set the device to be indestructible during gameplay, or deal damage to a certain team or class of player. For example:

    In racing games, players can refuel their cars like drivers do in Nascar or the Grand Prix.
    For team matches or games that use classes, players can have their own fuel pumps.
    In skillrun games, players have to complete a task before they can use the device.

Grind Powerup Devices

Give your players a status speed boost with this device!
Creative
Grind Powerup Devices

You can use the Grind Powerup device to force players to slide on any surface. As they slide, sparks fly from their feet with a spark effect. This effect, along with the ambient audio, shows how long the powerup lasts.

This can be useful in brawl games where you can offer a status buff to increase the damage they put out, or to boost their speed.

You can also use it in skillrun- or parkour-type games where you can raise stakes by forcing players to slip on a surface, making the run more challenging.

Grind Rail Devices

Place a customizable grind rail that lets you add, move, and delete nodes to create the perfect track for any map.
Creative
Grind Rail Devices

With the Grind Rail device, you can create grind rails as long as you need, with whatever curves, twists, and turns you want! You can create the perfect track and give your players a unique and fun way to traverse the environment on your island.

Grind Rail devices in Creative are similar to AI Patrol Path devices, in that they have two nodes (called Control Points in this device) when first placed. However the Grind Rail has two parts: The rail itself, and the Control Points you use to define and edit the shape and length of the rail. A minimum of two Control Points are required; if you remove all but one Control Point, it will remove the entire rail.

The rail and the Control Points have separate Customization panels, and separate options. Make sure you have the Control Point selected, and not the rail; if you accidentally click the rail it will move the whole thing instead of just moving the Control Point on the rail.

Use the Phone Tool's Copy function on one of the original two Control Points in order to add a new Control Point to the rail. You can use the Cut function to move a Control Point to a different position on the rail, or to change the rail's length. To safely remove one or more Control Points, use the Phone Tool's Select function on them first, then delete.

Rotating a Control Point adjusts the direction of the grind rail as it goes through that point, which is how you create curves and turns. You can adjust the sharpness or roundness of the curve by adjusting the Tangent Intensity option (see Device Options, below).
Finding and Placing the Device

Guard Spawner Devices

Fortnite Creative is converting many devices in the Fortnite Creative toolset to improve user experience across devices. These improvements include things like a better way for selecting colors or numeric values, more options for better device control and customization, and, for some devices, new functionality!

Currently, a public beta version of the upgraded devices is available for you to try. You can opt into using the upgraded devices with both existing islands and new experiences. To learn how to implement the changes, refer to the Converting to Upgraded Devices section.

The Guard Spawner can spawn a group of enemies that patrol an area to protect it from players. Like sentries, guards have a detection system. This means players can disguise themselves or engage in stealth tactics, which gives players more strategic options for gameplay. Unlike sentries, however, guards will act as a team to attack players, or help other guards on their team.

You can determine whether players can hire guards or not, and if they can be hired you can customize many additional options related to hiring. You can also enable players to give hired guards commands, using the Can Be Given Commands option. Players can use the middle mouse button, or press the left arrow on the D-pad, to open the Command Wheel.

While there isn't a limit on the number of Guard Spawners you can have on an island, there is a limit on the total number of spawned AI enemies on an island. This includes creatures, guards, and wildlife. You can only have 90 AI enemies active at a time, across all devices that spawn AI enemies. If you have a lot of Guard Spawners, or if you also have Creature or Wildlife Spawners on your island, keep track of the number of enemies each is spawning so you stay under the overall limit.
Finding and Placing the Device

Click image to enlarge.

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the CREATIVE inventory screen.

    Click the DEVICES tab. You can scroll to select the device, use the Search box to look up the device by name, or the Categories in the panel on the left.

    Click PLACE NOW to place immediately, or put the device in the QUICK BAR to place later.

    Press the Esc key to return to your island in Create mode. Use your phone to position the device, then click to place it. Press the Esc key to detach the device from your phone.

    Point at the device with your phone. If the CUSTOMIZE popup doesn't open immediately, move closer until it does, then press E to open the Customize panel.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to rename them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
Device Options

This device has some basic functionality, like choosing the type and number of guards, and whether guards can spawn through walls. Additionally, there are some advanced options, like how many guards are spawned, and the amount of time between spawns.

You can configure this device with the following options.

Default values are bold. Values that trigger contextual filtering are italic.

Despawn When Dismissed 	No, Yes 	Determines whether the hired guard automatically despawns when the player dismisses the guard.
Can Be Given Commands 	No, Yes 	Determines if a spawned Guard can be given commands. By default, only the most recently hired Guard can be given commands.
Upgraded Device Options
Converting to Upgraded Devices

The upgraded devices include a number of improvements:

    Updated UX across all devices.
    Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, converting to the upgraded devices is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you choose to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Once you decide to convert an island, you cannot undo the conversion. Therefore, if you want to convert an island to the upgraded devices, you should backup your island and then duplicate it. Using the duplicate island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you're satisfied, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Open the My Island settings, and click the Tools tab. Next to Upgrade Devices click Convert and Reload.
    A warning message displays. Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm.

Your island automatically reloads. You'll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island. Any placed devices that were on the island before conversion will now be the upgraded version, and any new devices you place will be the upgraded version.

Below are the following changes made to the device options:
New Option 	New Value 	Description 	Replaced Option
Spawn Count 	Pick a number 	Determines how many guards will spawn. 	This is a new option that replaces the Total Spawn Limit option.
Allow Infinite Spawn 	Yes, No 	Determines whether the device will spawn guards infinitely. If set to No, the following option becomes available: Total Spawn Limit. 	This is a new option that enhances the guard spawn options.
Guard Team Option 	Team Index, Team Wildlife & Creatures, Team Neutral 	Determines which type of team the guard will be assigned to. If set to Team Index, the Guard Team Index option becomes available. 	This is a new option that gives you more ways to use guards in team games.
Guard Team Index 	Team 1, Pick a team 	If you choose Team Index for Guard Team Option, this determines which team the spawned guards are allied with. 	 
Spawn on Timer 	On, Off 	Determines whether the guard is spawned on the Spawn Timer countdown, or spawned on events. If set to Off, the Spawn Timer option is hidden. 	Updated values
Show Spawn Radius 	Off, On 	Determines whether a preview of the spawn radius displays around the device when you are in Edit Mode on your island. 	 
Invulnerable 	Off, On 	Determines whether the guard is invulnerable. If set to On, the following options become available: Starting Shield and Max Shield. 	Updated values
Enable Patrol 	On, Off 	Determines whether the guard moves around or stays in place. 	This is a new option that replaces the Patrol Option option.
Change Patrol Path 	Never, On Spawn, On Timer 	Determines how often the spawner will select a new random patrol path within its patrol group. If set to On Timer the Change Patrol Path Timer option is displayed. 	New value with contextual filtering.
Change Patrol Path Timer 	Pick a time 	Determines the amount of time a guard will follow the patrol path. 	This is a new option that becomes available when the On Timer option is selected under Change Patrol Path.
Use Device Spawn Rotation 	On, Off 	Determines whether the orientation of a spawned guard matches the orientation of the device, or if it matches the orientation of the Patrol Path Node it spawns on. 	 
Play Spawn Visual Effect 	On, Off 	Determines whether a visual effect displays when a guard is spawned. 	 
Show Health Bar 	Yes, No 	Determines whether a health bar displays over a guard's head. 	 
Use Alertness 	On, Off 	Determines whether spawned guards display their alertness status over their heads. 	 
Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, which makes your workflow more intuitive, and gives you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations that exist in the channel communication system, because the devices communicate directly with other devices. When you're designing an island, you don't have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit, or planning out your channel allocation ahead of time.

Additionally, when you copy-paste devices you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions in the original carry over to the copies.

Each device placed will have a unique identifier assigned to it, which is needed for the events and functions to work correctly. The ID automatically assigned is a random set of numbers and letters, however, so as a best practice you should to name each device individually with something that has meaning and is easily remembered.

Below are the direct event binding options for this device.
Functions

Direct event binding uses functions as receivers. A function listens for one device's event to tell another device to perform a function.

Design Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use the Guard Spawner device.

    Door Spotted
    Guard Hire

Door Spotted

The action of a guard seeing a player can send a signal to other devices. Here is an example of a mechanic that can be implemented into a game that uses this.

Devices used:

    1 x Guard Spawner
    3 x AI Patrol Path Nodes
    1 x Lock
    1 x Player Spawner
    1 x Item Granter

    Create a simple hallway in an L shape, with a door at one side, and alcoves to hide in.

    Place an AI Patrol Path Node on one end of the L-shaped structure. Customize it to the following settings:
    Door Path
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Patrol Path Group 	Group 1 	The name of the AI patrol path you created.

    Copy and paste the initial AI Patrol Path Node. Set up two more that traverse around the corner and to the end of the L-shaped hallway.

    In front of the open door, place a Lock and customize it to the following settings:
    Door Lock
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Initial Door Position 	Open 	When the match starts, the door will automatically be open.

    Place a Guard Spawner in a convenient location on the map where you can group global devices. Customize it to the following settings:
    Door Guard
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Number of Guards 	1 	Maximum number of guards that can spawn at a time.
    Total Spawn Limit 	1 	Total spawns of guards as they are eliminated.
    Spawn Radius 	2.5M 	Distance from the spawner that a guard can appear.
    Spawn On Patrol Path 	Group 1 	The AI Patrol Path that the guards will spawn on and follow.

    Set the direct event bindings of the Guard Spawner to the following:
    Door Spawner
    Function 	Device 	Event 	Description
    On Alerted To Player Send Event To 	LockDevice 	Close 	When the guard sees the player, the door will close.
    On Eliminated Send Event To 	LockDevice 	Open 	When the guard is eliminated, the door will open.

    Place an Item Granter. Register an assault rifle to it, then customize it to the following settings:
    Door Path
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Equip Granted Item 	First Item 	The first item registered to the Item Granter is automatically equipped on spawn.

    Within a protected alcove that has cover to block a guard's line of sight if the player crouches, place a Player Spawner. Keep the default settings and set its direct event bindings to the following:
    Door Spawner
    Function 	Device 	Event 	Description
    On Player Spawned Send Event To 	ItemGranter 	Grant Item 	When the player spawns, they will be granted the assault rifle.

Here’s an overview of how devices communicate in this Design Example:
Device A 	Function 	Device B 	Event 	Explanation

LockDevice Lock Device
	Close 	

GuardSpawner Guard Spawner
	On Alerted To Send Event To 	When the guard sees the player, the door will close.

LockDevice Lock Device
	Open 	

GuardSpawner Guard Spawner
	On Eliminated Send Event To 	When the guard is eliminated, the door will open.

ItemGranter Item Granter
	Grant Item 	

PlayerSpawner Player Spawner
	On Player Spawned Send Event To 	When the player spawns, they will be granted the assault rifle.

You now have the basic functionality for having a door close and lock when a player is sighted by a guard, and unlocked when the player eliminates the guard.

As an alternative to having a player defeat the guard, you can have a button that the player can push to unlock the door. Navigating it through stealth will then become mandatory, or a player can return after eliminating the guards and try again.

You could also set the device to cause all guards to go on alert, or spawn hostile Sentry devices in chokepoints, suddenly making the level significantly more dangerous.
Guard Hire

Guards, like other AIs such as boars and wolves, can also be recruited by the player to help them in combat.

Devices used:

    4 x Guard Spawner
    2 x AI Patrol Path Nodes
    1 x Player Spawner

    Create a small T-shaped hallway with a safe spawning alcove at the bottom of the T.

    Place a Player Spawner in the alcove, using its default settings.

    Place a Guard Spawner within the alcove. Customize it to the following settings:

    Hire Spawner 1 Hire Spawner 2
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Number of Guards 	1 	The number of guards spawned by the device at one time.
    Team 	Team 1 	Set to the same team as the player's default.
    Spawn Timer 	1 Second 	Guards are spawned after a one second delay.
    Spawn Through Walls 	Off 	The guards cannot spawn past walls within their spawn radius.
    Spawn Radius 	2.5M 	The maximum distance a guard can spawn from its spawner.
    Patrol Option 	Disable Patrol 	Guards will stand in their initial spawn location instead of patrolling around.
    Can Be Hired 	Yes 	By interacting with the guards, you can have them follow you.

    Copy two more of this Spawn Manager and place them all within the alcove.

    Place an AI Patrol Path Node on one end of the T juncture hallway. Customize it to the following settings:
    AI Patrol Path Node Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Patrol Path Group 	Group 1 	The name of the AI patrol path for Guards to use.

    Copy and place a second AI Patrol Path Node on the other end of the hallway.

    Place a fourth Guard Spawner anywhere on the level, and customize it to the following settings:
    Enemy Guard Spawner
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Guard Type 	Ghost 	The physical model of the guard used.
    Number Of Guards 	2 	Maximum number of guards that can be spawned at once.
    Total Spawn Limit 	2 	Total number of guards that can be spawned.
    Team 	Team 2 	The enemy guards are set to a separate team.
    Spawn Timer 	1 Second 	Time interval before spawning guards.
    Spawn On Patrol Path Group 	Group 1 	Guards will spawn on the patrol path and follow it instead of spawn near the guard spawner.

You now have the basic functionality to hire guards that will fight enemy AIs — from creatures to other guards — in the player's defense.

Making it impossible for a player to do damage outside of using a melee weapon can make utilizing and sustaining the guards important. New guards could be recruited that despawn the old ones, with better statistics and health, gradually building up a standing army that follows the player. There can be many enemies, from creatures to animals to sentries and other guards that they will react to.

Creative
Health Powerup Devices

Fortnite Creative is converting many devices in the Fortnite Creative toolset to improve user experience across devices. These improvements include things like a better way for selecting colors or numeric values, more options for better device control and customization, and, for some devices, new functionality!

Currently, a public beta version of the upgraded devices is available for you to try. You can opt into using the beta toolset with both existing islands and new experiences. To learn how to implement the changes, refer to the Upgrade Devices section at the bottom of the document.

Health Powerup device regenerates a player's health, their shields, or their health and shields. You can configure this power-up to work in a variety of ways by customizing the device.
Finding and Placing the Device
Finding the health powerup device

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the Creative inventory window.
    Click the Devices tab and scroll to select the device. You can also use the Search box or the Categories panel on the left to find your device.
    Click PLACE NOW to place immediately, or put the device in the QUICK BAR to place later.
    Press Esc to return to your island in Create mode. Use your phone to position the device, then click to place it. Press Esc to detach the device from your phone tool.
    Point at the device with your phone. If the Customize popup doesn’t open immediately, move closer until it does, then press E to open the Customize panel.

Device Options

In default mode, this device modifies health only, and only for the player who touches it.

You can configure this device with the following options.

Default values are bold.
Basic Options
Option 	Value 	Description
Modify 	Health only, Shield only, Both 	Choose what statistic to apply the regeneration to. The Health Regeneration will change its look in-game depending on the choice selected.
Effect 	Flat Increase, % Increase, Flat Decrease, % Decrease, Set to 	Determines what effect occurs when a player obtains this powerup.

Values for this option are:

    Flat Increase increases the player's health or shield by a specified amount for each second that the powerup is active.
    % Increase increases the player's health/shield by the selected percentage of the player's max health/shield for each second that the powerup is active.
    Flat Decrease decreases the player's health/shield by the exact amount selected for each second that the powerup is active. Note that this causes damage to the player.
    % Decrease decreases the player's health/shield by the selected percentage of the player's max health or shield for each second that the powerup is active. This causes damage to the player.
    Set to sets the player's health or shields to whatever number you set, and will continually try to set the player's health or shield to that number as long as the powerup is active. For example, if you set this to 50, with the Effect Duration option set to Infinite, then the health or shields will stay at 50 as long as the powerup is active.

Effect Magnitude 	20, Select a number 	The number you select is used with the Effect option to modify the player's health/shield for each second the power-up is active. For example, an Effect Magnitude set to 5 while the Effect is set to % Increase will increase the players health/shield by 5% every second for as long as the powerup is active.
Effect Duration 	Instant, Select a time duration, Infinite 	The amount of time the powerup will stay active when picked up. When you choose Instant, the health increase will only happen once. All other choices apply durations for each second the powerup is active. For example, if the Effect Duration is set to 3 seconds, the health or shield is modified three times by the Effect and Effect Magnitude values selected.
Time to Respawn 	Never, Instant, 15 seconds, Select a time 	The amount of time after pickup for the powerup to respawn.
Ambient Audio 	On, Off 	If set to On, Ambient Audio will play when a player gets near the powerup.
All Options (Additional)
Option 	Value 	Description
Show Visual Effect on Player 	Yes, No 	If you select Yes, a visual effect will display while the powerup is active.
Disables Effect on Pickup 	Yes, No 	If you set to Yes, powerup effects will be cancelled when the powerup is picked up. This can be used to disable the Health Powerup that the player had picked up earlier.
Pickup Radius 	On Touch, Select a range In meters 	How close the player must be before the Health Powerup can be picked up.
Spawn on Minigame Start 	Yes, No 	If your game has a minigame, this determines when the powerup appears. If set to Yes, the powerup appears instantly at start of minigame. If set to No, the powerup appears based on the Time to Respawn setting.
Pick Up Audio 	On, Off 	If set to On, a sound will play when a player picks up the powerup.

Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system, but in the near future all islands that are still using the channels system will automatically be converted, which may break your islands.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below.

When one device needs to “talk” to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.
Option 	Value 	Description
Spawn When receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel number 	Immediately spawn this power-up when receiving from the specified channel.
Despawn When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel number 	Immediately despawn this power-up when receiving from the specified channel.
Pickup When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel number 	Picks up the powerup when receiving from the specified channel
Transmitters

Transmitters send a signal when triggered on a channel.
Option 	Value 	Description
When Item Picked Up Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick a channel number 	Send a signal to the specified channel when the powerup is picked up.
Design Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use the Health Powerup.

    Global Regeneration
    Super Regeneration (Almost Invincible)
    Damage over Time
    Healing Your Team

Global Regeneration

This example shows how to give a player the Health Powerup on game start. With this, the player will regenerate health and shields after they take damage throughout the course of the game.

    Drop a Health Powerup, then customize the following options:
        Modify: Both
        Effect: Flat Increase
        Effect Magnitude: 1
        Effect Duration: Infinite

    Assign the Health Powerup to a player either through a Class, through Team Settings & Inventory, or by using any other ways you know to have the player start with this power-up.

    Now, when the player takes damage, they will regenerate 1 health and 1 shield every second for the duration of the game. You can modify this further by changing the Effect Magnitude to regenerate a bigger value, or change any of the other settings, such as Show Visual Effect on Player.

Designer's Tip

Another modification can be for a class-based game mode, with different classes having different regeneration rates through the customization of the Effect Magnitude parameter.
Super Regeneration (Almost Invincible)

Using the Health Powerup, you can make a player almost invincible for a limited amount of time.

    Drop a Health Powerup and then customize the following options.
        Modify: Both
        Effect: Set To
        Effect Duration: Set to 10 seconds. In this example, the player is invincible for 10 seconds, but the duration can be changed to any number.
        Effect Magnitude: 2500
        Pickup Radius: On Touch

    Once a player picks up this powerup, they will regenerate 2500 health and 2500 shields that will be replenished every second for 10 seconds. Their health and shields will not go higher than the maximum set in Class settings or Player settings.

Designer's Tip

Combine this powerup with a class that has a very high health and shield maximum — like 2,500 maximum health and shields. As soon as the powerup is activated with this new class, the health and shields will increase by 2500 every second, effectively making the player invincible.
Damage Over Time

The Health Powerup can be used to damage players over time instead of healing them (which it does by default).

    Drop a Health Powerup and then customize the following options.
        Modify: Health Only
        Effect: % Decrease
        Effect Magnitude: 5
        Effect Duration: 10 Seconds

    When the player picks up the Health Powerup with these customized options, they will lose 5% of their health every second for 10 seconds.

Designer's Tip

This powerup can be modified to affect a specific class, team, or player, and you can change how much damage is done per second, the duration. and what is damaged (health, shields or both). This effect can be stopped if you pick up a Health Powerup that has Disables Effect on Pickup set to Yes, or when the timer expires.
Healing Your Team

The Health Powerup can be used to heal yourself and also a specific class or team, or even everybody in the game.

    Drop a Health Powerup and then customize the following options.
        Modify: Both
        Effect: Flat Increase
        Effect Magnitude: 10
        Effect Duration: 10 seconds
        Selected Class: 1
        Apply To: Player's Team

    With these settings, the powerup will restore the health for all players on the player's team that are Class 1 by 10% every 10 seconds.

Designer's Tip

These settings can be customized to apply to a different class or team, or the same class as the player. They can also be set to regenerate health and shields, along with all of the other options shown here.
Upgrade Devices

The upgrade device conversion includes a number of improvements:

    Updated UX across all devices.
    Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, the device conversion is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you opt to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Before opting in to the updated devices, you should first create a backup of your island. Using the backup island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you’re satisfied,, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Upgrade Devices > Convert and Reload.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. Your island automatically reloads with the Upgrade Devices. You’ll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island.

Below are the following changes made to the device options:
New Option 	New Value 	Description 	Replaced Option 	 
Stat To Modify 	Health Only, Shield Only, Both 	Determines which stat will be modified by this device. 	This is a new option that replaces the Modify option. 	Updated option.
Infinite Effect Duration 	No, Yes 	Determines if the amount of time the applied effect will stay active for is infinite. If set to Yes, the following option becomes hidden: Effect Duration. 	Updated values 	 
Respawn 	Yes, No 	After picking up, respawn this item after a custom amount of time. If set to No, the following option is hidden: Time to Respawn. 	This is a new option that enhances item respawn options. 	 
Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, making your workflow more intuitive, and giving you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations inherent in the channel communication system because the devices communicate directly instead of on channels. You no longer have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit or preplanning your channel allocation when designing an island.

When you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions set in the original carry over to the copies.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Event System > Convert.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. The Direct Event Binding System is automatically added to your devices.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.
Functions

Direct event binding uses functions as receivers. A function listens for one device's event to tell another device to perform a function.
Option 	Value 	Description
Spawn When receiving From 	Add 	Item immediately spawns.
Despawn When Receiving From 	Add 	The item despawns.
Pickup When Receiving From 	Add 	Player picks up the power up.
Events

Direct event binding uses events as transmitters. An event tells another device to perform a function.
Option 	Value 	Description
On Item Picked Up Send Event To 	Add 	the item is picked up.

Heavy Turret Devices

Give players a weapon that can eliminate vehicles on the ground or in the sky!
Creative
Heavy Turret Devices

Fortnite Creative is converting many devices in the Fortnite Creative toolset to improve user experience across devices. These improvements include things like a better way for selecting colors or numeric values, more options for better device control and customization, and, for some devices, new functionality!

Currently, a public beta version of the upgraded devices is available for you to try. You can opt into using the beta toolset with both existing islands and new experiences. To learn how to implement the changes, refer to the Upgrade Devices section at the bottom of the document.

The Mounted Anti-Vehicle Turret is a ground-based version of the turret on the Armored Battle Bus. You can place these devices around your island for players to use to eliminate vehicles, NPCs, or other players.

Some devices have a limit on how many times that device can be placed on an island. This is independent of how much memory the device uses. The limit for this device is 16, however the limit for all vehicle spawners is 32. So if you only place this turret, you can place up to 16 on an island. But if you have other vehicle spawners placed on your island, you may not be able to place that many turrets.
Finding and Placing the Device

Click image to enlarge.

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the CREATIVE inventory screen.

    Click the DEVICES tab. You can scroll to select the device, use the Search box to look up the device by name, or the Categories in the panel on the left.

Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, making your workflow more intuitive, and giving you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations inherent in the channel communication system because the devices communicate directly instead of on channels. You no longer have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit or preplanning your channel allocation when designing an island.

When you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions set in the original carry over to the copies.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Event System > Convert.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. The Direct Event Binding System is automatically added to your devices.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.
Functions

Direct event binding uses functions as receivers. A function listens for one device's event to tell another device to perform a function.
Option 	Value 	Description
Enable When Receiving From 	Add 	Enables the device.
Disable When Receiving From 	Add 	Disables the device.
Respawn Vehicle When Receiving From 	Add 	Respawn vehicle.
Destroy Vehicle When Receiving From 	Add 	Destroys vehicle.
Assigns Driver When Receiving From 	Add 	Seats the instigating player.
Events

Direct event binding uses events as transmitters. An event tells another device to perform a function.
Option 	Value 	Description
On Player Enters Vehicle Sen Event To 	Add 	Player enters the vehicle.
On Player Exits the Vehicle Send Event To 	Add 	Player exits the vehicle.
On Vehicle Spawns Send Event To 	Add 	The vehicle spawns.
On Vehicle Is Destroyed Send Event To 	Add 	The vehicle is destroyed.

Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system. However in the near future all new islands will use the new direct event binding system by default.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below, or the Direct Event Binding page.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.
Option 	Value 	Description
Enable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel number 	This enables the device when it receives a signal on the selected channel.
Disable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel number 	This disables the device when it receives a signal on the selected channel.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations that exist in the channel communication system, because the devices communicate directly with other devices. When you're designing an island, you don't have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit, or planning out your channel allocation ahead of time.

Additionally, when you copy-paste devices you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions in the original carry over to the copies.

Each device placed will have a unique identifier assigned to it, which is needed for the events and functions to work correctly. The ID automatically assigned is a random set of numbers and letters, however, so as a best practice you should to name each device individually with something that has meaning and is easily remembered.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Open the My Island settings, and click the Tools tab. Next to Event System, click Convert.
    A warning message displays. Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. Your island automatically reloads with the direct event binding system in place. Any devices you place will now have the Events and Functions tabs in the Customize panel, instead of Channels.

You can use this with other devices such as the HUD Message device, the Map Indicator device, and the Billboard device, to determine exactly how much information players have during your game, as well as how and when they get that information.

There are several ways you can change what information is shown in the HUD. You can change it in the My Island group of settings, using the HUD Controller device, or using a Team Settings & Inventoryamp;\inventory">Team Settings & Inventory device. The priority order for changes to the HUD is as follows:

    User Settings (reached by pressing Esc to open the Game Menu, then by clicking Settings) take priority over the other settings.
    The Team Settings & Inventory device takes priority over the HUD Controller and the My Island settings.
    The HUD Controller takes priority over the My Island settings.

There are two exceptions to the above priority hierarchy:

    If the My Island settings, or any device options, are set to hide certain parts of the HUD, a player cannot turn them on in User Settings. This is so all players have access to the same HUD information in the game.
    If the My Island settings, or any device options, are set to make parts of the HUD visible, a player can choose to turn them off in User Settings. This gives players the option to turn off parts of the HUD they don't need or want without affecting the experience of other players.

Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.

Creative
Ice Block Trap Devices

Use the Ice Block trap to add a movement modifier that causes players to skid on contact. Players can control their direction, but won't stop sliding until they are off the trap.

This trap can be placed on floor pieces. If a surface already exists when placing, the trap will snap to it automatically. If one does not exist, the trap will be placed on the ground and it will automatically create a floor piece to attach to.

This trap is not customizable. Use it as either an obstacle or an aid for game modes that rely on player movement.
Finding and Placing the Trap

Click to enlarge.

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the CREATIVE inventory window.
    Click the Devices tab and select Movement from the side Categories panel to find and select the device. You can also use the Search box to find the device.
    Click EQUIP to add the device to your Equipment bar, or click ADD TO CHEST to add it to the CHEST tab for use in a Chest or Llama.

Item Granter Devices

Use this device to place items in a player's inventory during the game.
Creative
Item Granter Devices

Fortnite Creative is converting many devices in the Fortnite Creative toolset to improve user experience across devices. These improvements include things like a better way for selecting colors or numeric values, more options for better device control and customization, and, for some devices, new functionality!

Currently, a public beta version of the upgraded devices is available for you to try. You can opt into using the beta toolset with both existing islands and new experiences. To learn how to implement the changes, refer to the Upgrade Devices section at the bottom of the document.

The Item Granter device can automatically place items into player inventories during your game, or you can set conditions for manually placing items in player inventories.

You can determine what items are granted, when they are granted, and set other conditions by configuring the device using the options listed below. You can also use other devices to trigger the Item Granter.

To register items with the Item Granter, follow these steps.

    In the Creative inventory, use the Weapons and Consumables tabs to find the items you want to register with the Item Granter. Click EQUIP to put them in your Player inventory.
    Stand directly beside the Item Granter.
    Press the Tab key to open the Creative inventory screen, then click PLAY to switch to the Player inventory screen.
    Click the desired item, then press either Z or X to split or drop the item. You can also drag the item to the side until a backpack icon appears.

When an item is registered with the Item Granter using the steps above, a hologram of the registered item will float above the device.

Like the Item Spawner, this device is the recommended method of delivering consumables and weapons to players in game.

The difference between the Item Spawner and the Item Granter is, the Item Spawner creates the registered item and drops it into the game world for players to pick up. The Item Granter automatically places the registered devices into the player's inventories.
Finding and Placing the Device

Click image to enlarge.

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the inventory window.
    Click the Devices tab and scroll to select the device. You can also use the Search box or the Categories panel on the left side of the screen to find your device.
    Click PLACE NOW to place immediately, or put the device in the QUICK BAR to place later.
    Press Esc to return to your island in Create mode. Use your phone to position the device, then click to place it. Press Esc to detach the device from your phone tool.
    Point at the device with your phone. If the CUSTOMIZE popup doesn't open immediately, move closer until it does, then press E to open the CUSTOMIZE panel.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to rename them. You can choose names that relate to each device’s purpose, so it’s easier to remember what each one does.
Device Options

The Item Granter has some basic functionality, like what item to grant to players, what to do with a player's existing inventory when granting an item, and whether to give a player extra ammo if the player is given a weapon. Additionally, there are some advanced options, like setting conditions for when a player is granted an item, if players from certain teams get different items, and how the items in the device are cycled.

Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system, but in the near future all islands that are still using the channels system will automatically be converted, which may break your islands.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.
Option 	Value 	Description
Enable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	Enables the device when it receives a signal from the selected channel.
Disable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	Disables the device when it receives a signal from the selected channel.
Grant Item When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	Grants an item to a player when it receives a signal from the selected channel.
Cycle To Previous Item When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	The device cycles to the previous item when it receives a signal from the selected channel.
Cycle To Next Item When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	The device cycles to the next item when it receives a signal from the selected channel.
Cycle To Random Item When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	The device cycles to a random item when it receives a signal from the selected channel.
Restock Items When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	If items have been removed from the device, the device is restocked with items when it receives a signal from the selected channel.
Clear Save Data For Player When Receiving On 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	This option only works when the Grant While Offline is set to Yes. When this device receives a signal on the selected channel, the instigating player no longer receives items when that player is offline.
Transmitters

Transmitters send a signal on the selected channel when triggered.
Option 	Value 	Description
When Item Granted Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	When the device grants an item to a player, it sends a signal on the selected channel.

Upgrade Devices

The upgrade device conversion includes a number of improvements:

    Updated UX across all devices.
    Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, the device conversion is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you opt to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Before opting in to the updated devices, you should first create a backup of your island. Using the backup island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you’re satisfied,, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Upgrade Devices > Convert and Reload.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. Your island automatically reloads with the Upgrade Devices. You’ll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island.

Below are the following changes made to the device options:
New Option 	New Value 	Description 	Replaced Option
Equip Granted Item 	No, Yes 	If the device gives items, equip the item listed here. If Yes is selected, the Item On Grant option becomes available. 	Updated value
Drop Items at Player Location 	If Inventory Is Full, Never, Always 	Whether or not to drop the time at the player's location rather than placing it in the inventory. If set to Never, the Ownership of Dropped Item option becomes hidden. 	Updated value
Grant On Timer 	Off, On 	Grant item to player at interval. If set to On, the Grant Time option becomes available. 	Updated value
Grant Time 	Pick a time 	Grant an item every X seconds. 	A new option that enhances the Grant On Timer option.
Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, making your workflow more intuitive, and giving you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations inherent in the channel communication system because the devices communicate directly instead of on channels. You no longer have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit or preplanning your channel allocation when designing an island.

When you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions set in the original carry over to the copies.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Select a device from the list and place on the island. (This step only applies to a new island.)
    Select My Island > Tools > Event System > Convert.
    Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. The Direct Event Binding System is automatically added to your devices.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.
Functions

Direct event binding uses functions as receivers. A function listens for one device's event to tell another device to perform a function.
Option 	Value 	Description
Enable When Receiving From 	Add 	Enables the device.
Disable When Receiving From 	Add 	Disables the device.
Grant Item When Receiving From 	Add 	Grants an item.
Cycle To Previous Item When Receiving From 	Add 	The device cycles to the previous item.
Cycle To Next Item When Receiving From 	Add 	The device cycles to the next item.
Cycle To Random Item When Receiving From 	Add 	The device cycles to a random item.
Restock Items When Receiving From 	Add 	If items have been removed from the device, the device is restocked with items.
Clear Save Data For Player When Receiving From 	Add 	This option only works when the Grant While Offline is set to Yes. the instigating player no longer receives items when that player is offline.
Events

Direct event binding uses events as transmitters. An event tells another device to perform a function.
Option 	Value 	Description
On Item Granted Send Event To 	Add 	The device grants an item to a player.
Item Placer Devices

Place weapons or consumable items in a more realistic way, such as sitting on a table or hanging on a wall.
Creative
Item Placer Devices

Fortnite Creative is upgrading many devices in the Fortnite Creative toolset to improve the user experience across Creative. These improvements include improvements to the Color Picker and numeric entry, more options for better device control and customization, and some devices even have new functionality!

Currently, a public beta version of the upgraded devices is available for you to use. You can opt into using the upgraded devices with both existing islands and new experiences. To learn how to convert your islands and experiences, refer to the Converting to Upgraded Devices section.

The Item Placer device gives you a way to place consumable items or weapons in locations that are more realistic, as opposed to Item Spawners or chests that just drop items and weapons on the ground. You can drop a consumable or weapon onto the device to register it. The device acts as a container, but is shaped like the item registered. When a player interacts with the device, it grants the registered item to that player. If the device is mounted on a destructible object and that object is destroyed, the registered item drops to the ground. Destructible objects can include props, building pieces, and terrain, depending on the settings you have modified in My Island or in other devices.

Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate. However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.

Creative
Item Remover Devices

Fortnite Creative is converting many devices in the Fortnite Creative toolset to improve user experience across devices. These improvements include:

    A Color Picker with swatches
    An Icon Picker with thumbnails of icons
    Direct entry for numeric values
    More options for better device control and customization

Some devices even have new options for increased functionality!

Currently, the upgraded devices are available in a public beta for you to try. You can use the upgraded devices with both existing islands and new experiences. To learn how to implement the changes, refer to the Converting to Upgraded Devices section.

The Item Remover gives gives you the ability to designate events in your games that will cause players to drop or lose items from their inventory. For example, if a player is Down But Not Out, they could drop items from their inventory, and other players could then pick up those items.
Finding and Placing the Device

Click image to enlarge.

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the CREATIVE inventory screen.

    Click the DEVICES tab. You can scroll to select the device, use the Search box to look up the device by name, or the Categories in the panel on the left.

Upgraded Device Options
Converting to Upgraded Devices

The upgraded devices include a number of improvements:

    Updated user experience (UX) across all devices.
    Improved user interface (UI) for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Once you decide to convert an island, you cannot undo the conversion. Therefore, if you want to convert an island to the upgraded devices, you should backup your island and then duplicate it.

Using the duplicate island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you're satisfied, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Open the My Island settings, and click the Tools tab. Next to Upgrade Devices click Convert and Reload.
    A warning message displays. Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm.

Your island automatically reloads with the upgraded devices. You'll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island. Any devices that were placed on the island before will now be the upgraded version, and any new devices you place will be the upgraded version.

Your island automatically reloads with the upgraded devices. You'll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island. Any devices that were placed on the island before will now be the upgraded version, and any new devices you place will be the upgraded version.

Below are the following changes made to the device options:
New Option 	New Value 	Description
Amount to Remove 	Amount in Device, Percentage 	Determines the quantity of selected items that should be removed from a player. When Percentage is selected the Percentage to Remove option becomes available.
Percentage to Remove 	100%, pick a percentage amount 	Determines the quantity for each item that should be removed from a player.
Remove All Variations of the Selected Item 	Off, On 	When turned on, all variations and rarities of hte selected item will be removed from the player.
Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system. However in the near future all new islands will use the new direct event binding system by default.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below, or the Direct Event Binding page.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.
Option 	Value 	Description
Enable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	Device is enabled when it receives a signal on the selected channel.
Disable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	Device is disabled when it receives a signal on the selected channel.
Remove When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	When the device receives a signal on the selected channel, items are removed from the activating player's inventory based on the items in the device.
Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, which makes your workflow more intuitive, and gives you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations that exist in the channel communication system, because the devices communicate directly with other devices. When you're designing an island, you don't have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit, or planning out your channel allocation ahead of time.

Additionally, when you copy-paste devices you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions in the original carry over to the copies.

Each device placed will have a unique identifier assigned to it, which is needed for the events and functions to work correctly. The ID automatically assigned is a random set of numbers and letters, however, so as a best practice you should name each device individually with something that has meaning and is easily remembered.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Open the My Island settings, and click the Tools tab. Next to Event System, click Convert.
    A warning message displays. Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm.

Your island automatically reloads with the direct event binding system in place. Any devices you place will now have the Events and Functions tabs in the Customization panel, instead of Channels.

Below are the Functions options for this device.

Design Examples

Here is an example of how you can use the Item Spawner device.

    Continuous Item Spawning

Continuous Item Spawning

To have items spawn nonstop after an event, combine an Item Spawner with a Switch.

Devices used:

    1 x Item Spawner
    1 x Switch

    Place an Item Spawner and drop as many items as you would like near the device to register them. Customize it to the following settings:
    Item Spawner Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Random Spawns 	Random 	Each time the Item Spawner spawns an item, a random item from the device’s registered items will be spawned.
    Base Visible During Game 	Off 	The base will not be visible during gameplay.
    Time Before First Spawn 	1 Second 	After being enabled, there will be a 1 second delay before the Item Spawner begins to spawn items.
    Time Between Spawns 	Instant 	There will be no delay between item spawns.
    Enabled At Game Start 	No 	The Item Spawner will not begin enabled and will not spawn items until it is enabled.
    Continuously Spawn Items 	On 	The Item Spawner will continue to spawn items regardless of whether or not they have been picked up.

    Place a Switch and customize it to the following settings:
    Switch Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Device Model 	Antique Lever 	The Switch will appear as an Antique Lever in game.

    Set the direct event bindings of the Switch to the following:
    Switch Events
    Function 	Device 	Event 	Description
    On Turned On Send Event To 	ItemSpawner 	Enable 	When the Switch is turned on, the Item Spawner will begin spawning items.
    On Turned Off Send Event To 	ItemSpawner 	Disable 	When the Switch is turned off, the Item Spawner will stop spawning items.

Here’s an overview of how devices communicate in this Design Example:
Device A 	Function 	Device B 	Event 	Explanation

ItemSpawner Item Spawner
	Enable 	

Switch Switch
	On Turned On Send Event To 	When the Switch is turned on, the Item Spawner will begin spawning items.

ItemSpawner Item Spawner
	Disable 	

Switch Switch
	On Turned Off Send Event To 	When the Switch is turned off, the Item Spawner will stop spawning items.

You now have the basic functionality for continuously spawning items.

This is a very effective technique to create rewards and sources of power for players. Try using different gameplay devices to enable the Item Spawner and begin the flow of items. Use a Trigger to start the spawning when a player enters a room, or try connecting a Guard Spawner so that the player will be rewarded after eliminating a guard.

Adjust the Time Between Spawns setting to find the spawn frequency that best fits your game mode.

Upgrade Your Island's Devices

You have the option to convert your islands to the new upgraded version of Creative devices. The upgraded devices include a number of improvements:

    Updated user experience (UX) across all devices.
    Improved user interface (UI) for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, the device conversion is optional, but will be the default for devices in the near future.

Once you decide to convert an island, you cannot undo the conversion. Therefore, if you want to convert an island to the upgraded devices, you should backup your island and then duplicate it.

Using the duplicate island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you're satisfied, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Open the My Island settings, and click the Tools tab. Next to Upgrade Devices click Convert and Reload.
    A warning message displays. Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm.

Your island automatically reloads with the upgraded devices. You'll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island. Any devices that were placed on the island before will now be the upgraded version, and any new devices you place will be the upgraded version.

Below are the following changes made to the device options:
New Option 	New Value 	Description 	Replaced Option
Spawn Item On Timer 	On, Off 	Set to specify how much time before an item spanws. When the option is set to Off, the Time Before First Spawn option is hidden. 	 
Respawn Item On Timer 	On, Off 	Use Time Between Spawns to specify how much time to wait before spawning the next item. When set to Off, the Time Between Spawns option is hidden. 	 
Invert Team 	No, Yes 	
	 
Invert Class 	No, Yes 	
	 
Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system. However in the near future all islands still using the channels system will automatically be converted, which might break your islands.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below, or the Direct Event Binding page.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.
Option 	Value 	Description
Enable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	Enables the device when it receives a signal from the selected channel.
Disable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	Disables the device when it receives a signal from the selected channel.
Cycle to Next Item When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	When this device receives a signal from the selected channel, it switches to the next item in the device.
Spawn Item When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	When this device receives a signal from the selected channel, the device spawns an item.
Transmitters

Transmitters send a signal on the selected channel when triggered.
Option 	Value 	Description
When Item Picked Up Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	When a player picks up a spawned item, the device sends a signal on the selected channel.
Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, which makes your workflow more intuitive, and gives you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations that exist in the channel communication system, because the devices communicate directly with other devices. When you're designing an island, you don't have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit, or planning out your channel allocation ahead of time.

Additionally, when you copy-paste devices you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions in the original carry over to the copies.

Each device placed will have a unique identifier assigned to it, which is needed for the events and functions to work correctly. The ID automatically assigned is a random set of numbers and letters, however, so as a best practice you should name each device individually with something that has meaning and is easily remembered.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Open the My Island settings, and click the *Tools tab. Next to Event System, click Convert**.
    A warning message displays. Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm.

Your island automatically reloads with the direct event binding system in place. Any devices you place will now have the Events and Functions tabs in the Customization panel, instead of Channels.

Below are the Functions and Events options for this device.

Design Examples

Here is an example of how you can use the Item Spawner device.

    Continuous Item Spawning

Continuous Item Spawning

To have items spawn nonstop after an event, combine an Item Spawner with a Switch.

Devices used:

    1 x Item Spawner
    1 x Switch

    Place an Item Spawner and drop as many items as you would like near the device to register them. Customize it to the following settings:
    Item Spawner Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Random Spawns 	Random 	Each time the Item Spawner spawns an item, a random item from the device’s registered items will be spawned.
    Base Visible During Game 	Off 	The base will not be visible during gameplay.
    Time Before First Spawn 	1 Second 	After being enabled, there will be a 1 second delay before the Item Spawner begins to spawn items.
    Time Between Spawns 	Instant 	There will be no delay between item spawns.
    Enabled At Game Start 	No 	The Item Spawner will not begin enabled and will not spawn items until it is enabled.
    Continuously Spawn Items 	On 	The Item Spawner will continue to spawn items regardless of whether or not they have been picked up.

    Place a Switch and customize it to the following settings:
    Switch Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Device Model 	Antique Lever 	The Switch will appear as an Antique Lever in game.

    Set the direct event bindings of the Switch to the following:
    Switch Events
    Function 	Device 	Event 	Description
    On Turned On Send Event To 	ItemSpawner 	Enable 	When the Switch is turned on, the Item Spawner will begin spawning items.
    On Turned Off Send Event To 	ItemSpawner 	Disable 	When the Switch is turned off, the Item Spawner will stop spawning items.

Here’s an overview of how devices communicate in this Design Example:
Device A 	Function 	Device B 	Event 	Explanation

ItemSpawner Item Spawner
	Enable 	

Switch Switch
	On Turned On Send Event To 	When the Switch is turned on, the Item Spawner will begin spawning items.

ItemSpawner Item Spawner
	Disable 	

Switch Switch
	On Turned Off Send Event To 	When the Switch is turned off, the Item Spawner will stop spawning items.

You now have the basic functionality for continuously spawning items.

This is a very effective technique to create rewards and sources of power for players. Try using different gameplay devices to enable the Item Spawner and begin the flow of items. Use a Trigger to start the spawning when a player enters a room, or try connecting a Guard Spawner so that the player will be rewarded after eliminating a guard.

Adjust the Time Between Spawns setting to find the spawn frequency that best fits your game mode.
Gameplay Examples Using Item Spawners
Launch Pad Devices

Launch players high into the sky!
Creative
Launch Pad Devices

Use the Launch Pad trap to hurl players into the sky on contact. The players can then use their gliders to navigate down toward the ground.

This trap can be placed on floor pieces. If a surface already exists when you place it, the trap will snap to it automatically. If one does not exist, the trap will be placed on the ground and it will automatically create a floor piece to attach to.

This trap is not customizable. Use it as either an obstacle or as an aid for game types that rely on player movement.
Finding and Placing the Trap

Click to enlarge.

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the CREATIVE inventory window.

    Click the Devices tab and select Movement from the side Categories panel to find and select the device. You can also use the Search box to find the device.

    Click EQUIP to add the device to your Equipment bar, or click ADD TO CHEST to add it to the CHEST tab for use in a Chest or Llama.

    Press Esc to return to your island in Create mode. Use your mouse to position the device, then right-click to place it. You can also press Y to place the device directly from your Equipment bar.

Click to enlarge.

You can equip up to 20 Launch Pads per stack.
Removing the Device

There are three ways you can remove a Launch Pad.

    You can remove this trap by aiming at the device with your phone and pressing X. Doing so will cause both the device and the foundation where it’s attached to be removed.
    You can remove the trap by destroying the foundation piece it is attached to.
    You can also destroy it by pressing F and attacking it with your pickaxe. The pickaxe will not destroy the trap if Pickaxe Destruction is set to None in My Island Settings.

Level Instance Devices

Use this device to save a collection of structures, terrain or props, and copy-paste the collection all over your island.
Creative
Level Instance Devices

The Level Instance device is a volume where you can place structures and props, then save the collection. If you need multiple groups of items that are all the same, you can copy and paste the device to place that grouping wherever you need it.

If you edit a copy of the Level Instance device (such as adding or removing props), the change is made to the original and all other copies.
Finding and Placing the Device

Click image to enlarge.

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the CREATIVE inventory screen.

    Click the DEVICES tab. You can scroll to select the device, use the Search box to look up the device by name, or the Categories in the panel on the left.

    Click PLACE NOW to place immediately, or put the device in the QUICK BAR to place later.

    Press Esc to return to your island in Create mode. Use your phone to position the device, then click to place it. Press Esc to detach the device from your phone.

    Point at the device with your phone. If the CUSTOMIZE popup doesn't open immediately, move closer until it does, then press E to open the Customize panel.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to rename them. You can choose names that relate to each device’s purpose, so it’s easier to remember what each one does.
Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
Device Options

This device has some basic functionality, like determining the size of the volume, and whether you can edit the items placed in the device.

You can configure this device with the following options.

Default values are bold. Values that trigger contextual filtering are italic.
Basic Options
Option 	Value 	Description
Edit State 	Editable, Locked 	Determines whether items can be added to this level instance. If you choose Locked, the size options do not display.

Level Loader Devices

Load levels created and saved with the Level Instance device, then move, rotate or stack the levels on top of each other.
Creative
Level Loader Devices

Using the Level Loader device, you can place levels that you've created and saved with the Level Instance device. You can place the Level Loader device on or off-grid, rotate it to any angle, and even place it on top of another Level Loader device! This gives you more flexibility when you place your levels on an island.

Here are some examples of how you can use this device:

    Make modular buildings by creating each modular piece in the Level Instance device and saving it as a level; then use the Level Loader to place and combine different modular pieces into unique structures.
    Create and save each level of a multi-floor structure with the Level Instance device, then stack them into buildings with the Level Loader.
    Create a customized gallery of building pieces or props using the Level Instance device, save as a level, then load and use those custom galleries with the Level Loader device.

Any building piece in a level used in a Level Loader device is automatically turned into a prop. This means they do not snap to the island's grid, and also means that those structures do not support player building pieces.

Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device documents we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.

Melee Designer Devices

Customize melee weapons with secondary actions, charge attacks, and more!
Creative
Melee Designer Devices

The Melee Designer creates customized weapons that you can use as loot that drops from enemies, or grant them to players directly using Item Spawner or Item Granter devices. The Customize panel for the Melee Designer is somewhat different from most other devices; refer to How to Use the Melee Designer below for more information.

Some ways you can customize a weapon are:

    Change the rarity for the weapon.

    Give the weapon a cool unique name.

    Choose special charge attacks for the weapon, such as Ground Pound, Drill, or Whirlwind.

    Adjust how much damage the customized weapon does to enemies or the environment with basic attacks, basic attack combos, jump attacks, or charge attacks.

    Adjust how much knockback a basic attack, jump attack, or charge attack inflicts on an opponent.

Set up your weapon the way you want it, then use the Melee Designer to spawn as many copies as you need. Because changes made to the options in the Melee Designer affect every weapon it spawns, you can rebalance your game at any time.

Deleting a Melee Designer device will cause all weapons spawned from it to permanently revert to default settings.
How to Use the Melee Designer

The Customize panel for the Melee Designer device works a little bit differently from other devices in Creative. When you place a Melee Designer and open the Customize panel, you are prompted to choose a weapon type (sword or hammer).
Choose a Weapon

Once you choose the weapon type, you cannot change the weapon for that device. If you change your mind about the weapon type, you have to place another Melee Designer device and choose the other weapon.
Spawn the Customized Weapon

When you begin to customize your sword or hammer, you can give the weapon a special name. For example, if you want it to be a powerful unique weapon, give it a special name that connects to the narrative, or theme, or characters of your island.
Create a Named Weapon

If you want to create a category of weapons spawned from the current Melee Designer, which all have the same stats and abilities, you can use a more general name such as "Cavalry Sword" or "Knight's Hammer".
Create a Special Weapon Type

If you have many Melee Designer devices, it might be helpful to rename the device with the name you choose for the weapon – that way you can easily see which device spawns each weapon type.

Each Melee Designer device can spawn multiple weapons, and each spawned weapon will have the statistics and abilities you choose in the Customize panel. If you change the customizations in that device, all weapons spawned from that device will have the new customizations. If you delete a Melee Designer device, any weapons spawned from that device will lose all customizations and return to the base weapon defaults.
Normal Weapon Attacks

The sword and hammer weapons have several attacks available, even if you don't choose special actions or charge attacks. This section describes these normal attacks and how you can modify them in the Melee Designer.
Basic Attack

For mouse and keyboard, press the left mouse button to perform a basic attack. For consoles, press the normal attack button or trigger to perform a basic attack.
Sword Basic Attack 	Hammer Basic Attack
Basic Attack Combo

To perform a basic attack combo, press the attack control repeatedly. When using the sword, the player can perform a three-stroke combo, a four-stroke combo, or a five-stroke combo. When using the hammer, the player can perform a three-stroke combo with the final stroke hitting twice.
Sword Combos 	 
Two-stroke combo 	Three-stroke combo
Four-stroke combo 	Five-stroke combo
Hammer Combos 	 
Two-stroke combo 	Three-stroke combo
Jump Attack

Press the jump button or key, then the attack control, to perform a jump attack. The player will jump into the air and then bring the weapon slamming downward.
Sword Jump Attack 	Hammer Jump Attack
Sprint Attack

Press the attack control while sprinting to perform a sprint attack. The player sprints forward and then performs a powerful backhand slash (for the sword), or a backhand slam (for the hammer).
Sword Sprint Attack 	Hammer Sprint Attack
Special Actions and Attacks

The Melee Designer provides a large number of options for customizing a sword or hammer. Some of these options grant the player special actions or attacks. This section will describe the special actions and attacks that are available, and how they affect a player.
Secondary Action - Dodge

If you customize a weapon with the Secondary Action option and select Dodge Only, a player who uses this customized weapon will be granted a special type of movement while they are using the weapon. By using a movement control (such as the WASD keys on a keyboard, or the left stick of a controller) and pressing the special action button or key (such as the right mouse button), the player will perform a dodge in the following ways:

    Forward: the player will roll forward in a somersault.

    If you set the Secondary Action option to Dodge and Block, players will not be able to do the forward roll. Instead, if the forward movement control is pressed, the player will jump forward while blocking.

    Left: the player will make a short jump to the left.

    Right: the player will make a short jump to the right.
    Backward: the player leaps backward from their original position (potentially disengaging from an opponent or trap).

Secondary Action - Block

If you customize a weapon with the Secondary Action option and select Block Only or Dodge and Block, pressing the secondary action key will move the melee weapon into a blocking position.

If you choose Dodge and Block, the player can block and also use Dodge by following these steps:

    Press and hold the key or button for Block.

    Press the movement control (left, right, or backward) and then immediately press the Jump key or button. This should initiate the left, right, or backward dodge. While blocking, the player cannot perform the forward roll dodge; instead they just jump up and forward. This is designed so that the player can perform a Jump Attack while blocking.

Charge Attacks

You can customize a sword or hammer with one of three charge attacks: Ground Pound, Drill, or Whirlwind.

    Ground Pound: the player jumps into the air, performs an aerial flip, and slams the weapon downward with increased force.

Drill: the player dives forward with the weapon held out in front, and spins like a drill.

Whirlwind: the player holds the weapon out and spins rapidly in a circle, damaging everyone and everything in its radius.

To perform a charge attack, press and hold the attack control. The weapon begins to glow, and when it is ready to activate there is a visual effect cue. If you customize a melee weapon with the Charge Attack option, you can determine how long the weapon must charge to activate the special attack. The player will be vulnerable while the weapon is charging up, and if they try to attack the charge depletes and they have to start over.
Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate. However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
Finding and Placing the Device

    From Build mode, press the Tab key to open the CREATIVE inventory screen.

    Click the DEVICES tab. You can scroll to select the device, use the Search box to look up the device by name, or use the Categories in the panel on the left.

Message Feed Devices

Using this device, you can create customized messages that display in a player's message feed.
Creative
Message Feed Devices

The Message Feed device gives you the ability to send a short message to the player's message feed. In an elimination confirmed game mode, this could be used to broadcast when eliminations are confirmed or when points are granted. For other game modes, such as capture the flag or domination, the feed could include messages about flags captured or returned, areas that change teams, or other events in a game. In fast-paced game modes, this device gives you the ability to provide players with an on-screen stream of information about rapidly changing conditions.
Finding and Placing the Device

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the CREATIVE inventory screen.

    Click the DEVICES tab. You can scroll to select the device, use the Search box to look up the device by name, or the Categories in the panel on the left.

Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system. However in the near future all new islands will use the new direct event binding system by default.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below, or the Direct Event Binding page.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.
Option 	Value 	Description
Send Message When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel number 	When the device receives a signal on the selected channel, it generates a message in the message feed.

Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, which makes your workflow more intuitive, and gives you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations that exist in the channel communication system, because the devices communicate directly with other devices. When you're designing an island, you don't have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit, or planning out your channel allocation ahead of time.

Additionally, when you copy-paste devices you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions in the original carry over to the copies.

Each device placed will have a unique identifier assigned to it, which is needed for the events and functions to work correctly. The ID automatically assigned is a random set of numbers and letters, however, so as a best practice you should name each device individually with something that has meaning and is easily remembered.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or make a new island.

    When you are on your island, open the My Island settings, and click the Tools tab.

    Next to Event System, click Convert.

    A warning message displays. Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm.

Your island automatically reloads with the direct event binding system in place. Any devices you place will now have the Events and Functions tabs in the Customize panel, instead of Channels.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.
Functions

Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.

Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, which makes your workflow more intuitive, and gives you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations that exist in the channel communication system, because the devices communicate directly with other devices. When you're designing an island, you don't have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit, or planning out your channel allocation ahead of time.

Additionally, when you copy-paste devices you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions in the original carry over to the copies.

Each device placed will have a unique identifier assigned to it, which is needed for the events and functions to work correctly. The ID automatically assigned is a random set of numbers and letters, however, so as a best practice you should name each device individually with something that has meaning and is easily remembered.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or make a new island.
    When you are on your island, open the My Island settings, and click the Tools tab.
    Next to Event System, click Convert.
    A warning message displays. Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm.

Your island automatically reloads with the direct event binding system in place. Any devices you place will now have the Events and Functions tabs in the Customize panel, instead of Channels.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.

Movement Modulator Devices

Use Movement Modulators to temporarily change the speed of players and vehicles.
Creative
Movement Modulator Devices

The Movement Modulator trap is a device you can use to apply speed increases or decreases to players or vehicles. Players can physically stand on or drive over the device to activate it for their character or vehicle. The duration of the effect can be adjusted.

For players, the effect can be applied using a remote trigger.

For vehicles, the device increases the top speed of the vehicle, so it has a minimal effect on vehicles that rarely reach maximum speed.

The device color changes based on its state.

    Green means it provides a speed boost.
    Red provides a speed decrease.
    Gray indicates that the device is disabled.

A pulsing effect over the trap shows how fast the effect applied will be. Faster pulses mean it will apply a faster speed to the player or vehicle.

When applied to a player, the player will have a colored effect around their legs to show the speed change. This effect will be green if it's a speed boost, and red if it's a decrease.

Channels

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.

Design Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use the Mutator Zone.

    Emote Scoring
    Low Gravity Zones
    No Shooting Zones
    Dropped Item Decay Timers

Emote Scoring

This example shows how to set up an additional method of generating score in a game. Within a designated Mutator Zone, score can be increased each time an emote is performed. Teams can fight for control of emoting points and try to eliminate each other in the process of using them.

You will need the following devices.

    1x Mutator Zone
    1x Score Manager
    1x HUD Message Device

    Build the location where players will emote, then place the Mutator Zone device on it with the following settings. Adjust the width, depth, and height to incorporate your chosen area if needed.
    Mutator Zone Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    On Player Starts Emoting Transmit On 	Channel 1 	Transmits a signal to the Score Manager to increase the score each time a player starts an emote, and the HUD Message Device to send a message to the player notifying them of success.

    Place a Score Manager anywhere on your island and customize the following settings.
    Score Manager Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Score Value 	10 	The amount of score awarded per emote. Use any amount you want.
    Play Audio 	No 	Audio for the Score Manager awarding points is disabled.
    Activate When Receiving From 	Channel 1 	The Mutator Zone transmits this signal when an emote takes place within it, incrementing the score by the Score Value amount.

    Place down a HUD Message device anywhere on your island and customize the following settings.
    HUD Message Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Message 	10 Score Gained! 	The message given to the player upon emoting in the Mutator Zone.
    Message Recipient 	Triggering Player 	Who receives the broadcast HUD message. In this case, only the person emoting.
    Time From Round Start 	Off 	Unless set to off, this will automatically play the HUD message after a predetermined time.
    Display Time 	3 Seconds 	Duration of the HUD message.
    Message Priority 	Critical 	The message will immediately pop up and overwrite any other HUD messages with an exclamation mark.
    Play Sound 	None 	The sound effects for activating the HUD device are disabled.
    Placement 	Top Center 	Where the HUD message is displayed.
    Show When Receiving From 	Channel 1 	Activates when receiving a signal from Channel 1, done when someone emotes within the Mutator Zone.

You now have created a zone that awards score when any player emotes.

Score can be awarded to either the individual player or the team. You can also hook up spotlights or even a radio to draw attention to someone emoting or make the HUD message display game wide to give people an opportunity to interrupt or attack the person emoting.
Low Gravity Zones

This example showcases one of the unique features of the Mutator Zone, the ability to adjust gravity within a zone instead of the entire island. Players can be made heavier or much lighter, affecting jump height and fall speed. Many other settings can be similarly adjusted within a Mutator Zone, and this will illustrate one of them.

You will need the following devices.

    1x Mutator Zone
    5x Barrier

    First, build a simple set of towers or other showpieces for selective low gravity. Place the Mutator Zone in the center of the area you want to be affected and use the following settings as a guideline.
    Mutator Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Zone Width 	Variable 	Although 3 was used in this example, set the width to the appropriate size for your own area.
    Zone Depth 	Variable 	Although 3 was used in this example, set the depth to the appropriate size for your own area.
    Zone Height 	Variable 	This should be high enough to cover the maximum distance a player can jump. 15 extended well past the top of the towers in the example video.
    Gravity 	Very Low 	The setting which affects the gravity, set to the lowest amount to duplicate moon-style leaping within the enabled Mutator Zone.

    On all four sides and the roof, place a barrier of the appropriate size to completely enclose the play area. Use the following settings as a guideline.
    Barrier Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Barrier Style 	Starfield (Red) 	The look of the barrier. Starfields will give an outer space feel and a sense of great distance.
    Barrier Depth 	Variable 	Depth is the length of the barrier, and although 7 was used in this example for some of the barriers, make sure to adjust the numbers to create a seamless box around your own play area. The rooftop barrier will also need to use Barrier Width.
    Barrier Height 	Variable 	Height should extend above where players can possibly jump. The sense of distance from the Starfield does not require the barrier to be placed far away. The rooftop barrier only needs a height of 1.

You now have an area of selective low gravity you can include in your island.

You can also create buttons or other triggers that can temporarily turn on low gravity or even high gravity across your entire play area. These special zones are great additions to a Skillrun, or certain vertical points in a free-for-all arena, or even in space-themed adventure islands. Other settings can also be done in limited areas, such as movement speed, building resource cost, or building speed of player forts.
No Shooting Zones

Through the use of a signal, in this case, transmitted by a switch, it's possible to turn a Mutator Zone off and on making it so the properties within are not continuously applied. This example creates a safe zone where players are unable to fire at each other.

You will need the following devices.

    1x Mutator Zone
    1x Switch
    1x HUD Message Device

    Place the Mutator Zone in the area you do not wish players to fire weapons. For example, a simple building was created with brick floors. Put in the following settings.
    Mutator Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Zone Width 	Variable 	Although 2 was used in the example, set the width to the appropriate size for your own area.
    Zone Depth 	Variable 	Although 2 was used in the example, set the depth to the appropriate size for your own area.
    Zone Height 	Variable 	Although 2 was used in the example, set the height to the appropriate size for your own area.
    Enabled During Phase 	None 	By default, the Mutator Zone is not enabled and will have no effect on gameplay until turned on.
    Disable When Receiving From 	Channel 2 	If the Mutator Zone is enabled in-game, this channel will allow it to disable and turn back off.
    Enable When Receiving From 	Channel 1 	When a signal is received from Channel 1, the Mutator Zone is enabled, and the default behavior of stopping weapons from firing takes effect while inside it.
    On Player Entering Zone Transmit On 	Channel 3 	Tells the HUD to send a message to the player when they enter the enabled Mutator Zone letting them know weapons cannot be fired.
    On Player Exiting Zone Transmit On 	Channel 4 	Tells the HUD to clear the message if it's still up when the player leaves the enabled Mutator Zone.

    Place a switch nearby to test sending signals, and use the following settings.
    Switch Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Device Model 	Antique Lever 	The visual look of the switch. This can be anything that you prefer and does not affect functionality.
    When Turned On Transmit On 	Channel 1 	When you first hit the switch, it transmits a signal to Channel 1 which enables the Mutator Zone to prevent firing within it.
    When Turned Off Transmit On 	Channel 2 	When you hit the switch a second time, it transmits a signal on Channel 2 and disables the Mutator Zone again, allowing weapon fire again.

    To include announcements about the state of the safe zone, place a HUD Message Device anywhere on the map with the following settings.
    HUD Message Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Message 	No Shooting On The Brick! 	The message is sent to the player when they enter an enabled Mutator Zone.
    Message Recipient 	Triggering Player 	Only the player entering the Mutator Zone will receive the message.
    Time From Round Start 	Off 	Unless set to off, this will automatically play the HUD message after a predetermined time.
    Display Time 	3 Seconds 	Duration of the HUD message.
    Message Priority 	Critical 	Will immediately pop up and overwrite any other HUD messages with an exclamation mark.
    Play Sound 	None 	The sound effects for activating the HUD device are disabled.
    Placement 	Top Center 	Where the HUD message is displayed.
    Show When Receiving From 	Channel 3 	When a player enters an enabled Mutator Zone, it transmits a signal on Channel 3, which will cause them to see this message.
    Hide When Receiving From 	Channel 4 	Upon exiting an enabled Mutator Zone, this signal is transmitted to the device, clearing any HUD text that might still be on the screen.

You now have demonstrated how to transmit signals to enable and disable Mutator Zones, and functionality for entering and leaving enabled ones for additional signal transmission.

You can set up spawn rooms in a free for all or even team-based arenas without bases that use teleporters or leaping entrances into the map where everyone can use vending machines without shooting each other by having the mutator always be on in the area. There are countless other uses for Mutator Zones detecting when people enter and exit their volume that can also be taken advantage of.
Dropped Item Decay Timers

This example shows how to use the Mutator Zone to prevent excessively building up dropped weapons, consumables, and building resources within it's volume. Through using the settings, you can dictate how long they remain on the floor. This functionality can also be enabled or disabled through channels.

You will need the following devices.

    1x Mutator Zone
    5x Vending Machine
    1x Switch

    Place the Mutator Zone over the area you want dropped items to decay, and use the following settings.
    Mutator Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Allow Weapon Fire 	Yes 	Allows weapon firing from inside the Mutator Zone volume.
    Zone Width 	Variable 	Although 2 was used in the example, set the width to cover the entire area you want dropped items removed.
    Zone Depth 	Variable 	Although 3 was used in the example, set the depth to cover the entire area you want dropped areas removed. If needed, make sure to also increase Zone Height.
    Enabled During Phase 	None 	By default, the Mutator Zone is not enabled and will have no effect on gameplay until enabled.
    Pick Up Life Span 	5 Seconds 	Determines the lifetime of all pick-ups on the ground within the enabled Mutator Zone volume.
    Disable When Receiving From 	Channel 2 	If the Mutator Zone is enabled, receiving a signal from this zone will disable it and prevent it from clearing pick-ups from the floor after five seconds.
    Enable When Receiving From 	Channel 1 	Until receiving a signal from this channel, the Mutator Zone will have no effect. Upon being enabled, it will begin clearing pick-ups from the floor after five seconds.

    Place the five vending machines against a wall, and drag and drop any desired weapons within for testing. The default settings for vending machines are fine for this example.

    Place a switch nearby to demonstrate the zone, and customize the following settings.
    Mutator Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Device Model 	Toggle Switch 	The visual look of the switch. This can be anything that you prefer and does not affect functionality.
    When Turned On Transmit On 	Channel 1 	When the switch is activated, the Mutator Zone is enabled and will set all pick-ups on the ground to 5 seconds before deteriorating.
    When Turned Off Transmit On 	Channel 2 	Disables the Mutator Zone when activated a second time, removing the pick-up clearing effect.

You now have a toggleable Mutator Zone to cause pick-ups on the ground to decay.

This zone might always be enabled with a longer decay timer for areas intended to pick up weaponry. It can also be set across the entire island with a 30 second lifetime if you want something like an Elimination Manager to drop ammo, building resources, or randomized weapons without it overpopulating the island over time.

Nitro Drifter Spawner Devices

Time to drift! Use these Cyber-City themed cars in your racing games or anywhere you want a fast, stylish vehicle for players to use.
Creative
Nitro Drifter Spawner Devices

The Nitro Drifter Spawner is a fast, stylish car that seats four to encourage social play. The visual look of the vehicle is themed around Cyber-City and fits well with a cyberpunk or Neo-Tokyo aesthetic. This car also has unique handling, with the ability to drift. This works particularly well with racing games, but can add style to any game mode where vehicles are available.

Some devices have a limit on how many times that device can be placed on an island. This is independent of how much memory the device uses. If you have not converted your island to use upgraded devices, you can only have 32 active vehicles spawned at one time (across all vehicle spawners). If you have converted your island, there is no limit.
Finding and Placing the Device

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the CREATIVE inventory screen.

    Click the DEVICES tab. You can scroll to select the device, use the Search box to look up the device by name, or the Categories in the panel on the left.

    Click PLACE NOW to place immediately, or put the device in the QUICK BAR to place later.

    Press Esc to return to your island in Create mode. Use your phone to position the device, then click to place it. Press Esc to detach the device from your phone.

    Point at the device with your phone. If the Customize popup doesn't open immediately, move closer until it does, then press E to open the Customize panel.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to rename them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
Device Options

This device has some basic functionality, like whether the device is visible during a game, and whether the vehicle uses fuel. Additionally, there are some advanced options, like whether the vehicle can use boost and what happens when the vehicle explodes.

Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system. However in the near future all new islands will use the new direct event binding system by default.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below, or the Direct Event Binding page.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.
Option 	Value 	Description
Assigns Driver When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel number 	When the device receives a signal on the selected channel, it seats the instigator as the driver.
Respawn Vehicle When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel number 	When the device receives a signal on the selected channel, it respawns a vehicle. This destroys any existing spawned vehicle.
Destroy Vehicle When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel number 	When the device receives a signal on the selected channel, it destroys the spawned vehicle.
Enable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel number 	The device is enabled when it receives a signal on the selected channel.
Disable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel number 	The device is disabled when it receives a signal on the selected channel.
Transmitters

Transmitters send a signal on the selected channel when triggered.
Option 	Value 	Description
When Player Enters Vehicle Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel number 	When a player enters a vehicle, the device transmits a signal on the selected channel.
When Player Exits Vehicle Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel number 	When a player exits a vehicle, the device transmits a signal on the selected channel.
When Vehicle Spawns Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel number 	When a vehicle spawns, the device transmits a signal on the selected channel.
When Vehicle is Destroyed Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel number 	When a spawned vehicle is destroyed, the device transmits a signal on the selected channel.
Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, which makes your workflow more intuitive, and gives you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations that exist in the channel communication system, because the devices communicate directly with other devices. When you're designing an island, you don't have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit, or planning out your channel allocation ahead of time.

Additionally, when you copy-paste devices, you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions in the original carry over to the copies.

Each device placed will have a unique identifier assigned to it, which is needed for the events and functions to work correctly. The ID automatically assigned is a random set of numbers and letters, however, so as a best practice you should name each device individually with something that has meaning and is easily remembered.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or make a new island.

    When you are on your island, open the My Island settings, and click the Tools tab.

    Next to Event System, click Convert.

    A warning message displays. Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm.

Your island automatically reloads with the direct event binding system in place. Any devices you place will now have the Events and Functions tabs in the Customize panel, instead of Channels.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.

Design Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use the Perception Trigger device.

    Hide and Seek
    Moving Target

Hide and Seek

Create a hide-and-seek game using the Perception Trigger as the seeker. To make the game more interesting, turn the Perception Trigger on and off every 5 seconds to give the player opportunities to move around the room.

Devices used:

    1 x Perception Trigger
    1 x Damage Volume
    1 x HUD Message
    2 x Timed Objective

    Create a simple hide-and-seek area with different obstacles to block the seeker’s sightline.

    Place a Damage Volume in the center of the play area and customize it to the following settings:
    Hide and Seek Damage Volume Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Zone Width 	7 	The Damage Volume will be 7 tiles wide. Adjust this setting so the Damage Volume encompasses the entire area of the game.
    Zone Depth 	3 	The Damage Volume will be 3 tiles deep. Adjust this setting so that the Damage Volume encompasses the entire area of the Hide and Seek game.
    Damage Type 	Elimination 	If a player is inside of the Damage Volume, they will be immediately eliminated.
    Enabled During Phase 	None 	The Damage Volume will begin disabled.

    Place a HUD Message outside of the play area and customize it to the following settings:
    Hide and Seek HUD Message Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Message 	You’ve Been Spotted! 	This message will show when the player is spotted by the Perception Trigger.
    Time From Round Start 	Off 	The message will not be shown automatically after the round starts.

    Place a large Perception Trigger toward one end of the play area and customize it to the following settings:
    Hide and Seek Perception Trigger Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Enabled on Game Start 	Disabled 	The Perception Trigger will be disabled when the game starts.

    Set the direct event bindings of the Perception Trigger to the following:
    Hide and Seek Perception Trigger Events
    Function 	Device 	Event 	Description
    On Device Sees A Player Send Event To 	DamageVolume 	Enable 	When the player is spotted, the Damage Volume will turn on, eliminating them.
    On Device Sees A Player Send Event To 	SeenHUDMessage 	Show 	When the player is spotted, they will be shown a HUD Message telling them that they were spotted.

    To create the effect of the eye turning on and off every 5 seconds, you will use two Timed Objectives. Place a Timed Objective outside of the play area. This will be the device that enables the Perception Trigger, so give it a clear name. Customize it to the following settings:
    Hide and Seek Start Timed Objective Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Start When Round Starts 	Yes 	The Timed Objective will begin counting when the round starts.
    Time 	5 Seconds 	The Timed Objective will complete after 5 seconds.
    Timer Label Text 	The eye will see in… 	The HUD will display this label before the countdown.
    Visible During Game 	No 	The Timed Objective itself will not be visible during gameplay.
    Completion Behavior 	Reset 	After completing the countdown, the Timed Objective will reset and will be ready to be started again.
    Audio Effects 	Off 	The Timed Objective will not play any audio effects.

    Place another Timed Objective outside of the play area. This will be the device that disables the Perception Trigger, so give it a clear name that differentiates it from the other Timed Objective. Customize it to the following settings:
    Hide and Seek Stop Timed Objective Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Time 	5 Seconds 	The Timed Objective will complete after 5 seconds.
    Timer Label Text 	The eye will stop looking in… 	The HUD will display this label before the countdown.

    Completion Behavior 	Reset 	After completing the countdown, the Timed Objective will reset and will be ready to be started again.
    Audio Effects 	Off 	The Timed Objective will not play any audio effects.

    Set the direct event bindings of the first Timed Objective to the following:
    Hide and Seek Start Timed Objective Events
    Function 	Device 	Event 	Description
    On Completed Send Event To 	PerceptionTrigger 	Enable when Receiving From 	When this Timed Objective completes, it enables the Perception Trigger.
    On Completed Send Event To 	StopLookingTimedObjective 	Start 	When this Timed Objective completes, it starts the countdown on the other Timed Objective.

    Set the direct event bindings of the second Timed Objective to the following:
    Hide and Seek Stop Timed Objective Events
    Function 	Device 	Event 	Description
    On Completed Send Event To 	PerceptionTrigger 	Disable when Receiving From 	When this Timed Objective completes, it disables the Perception Trigger.
    On Completed Send Event To 	StartLookingTimedObjective 	Start 	When this Timed Objective completes, it starts the countdown on the other Timed Objective.

Here’s an overview of how devices communicate in this example:

You now have the basic functionality for a hide and seek game using the Perception Trigger.

This basic functionality could be extended and applied in many different game modes for interesting results. You could create a game where the player needs to reach a certain objective without being spotted. Or consider exploring a competitive multiplayer mode in which players have to battle one another while avoiding being seen by the eye. There are many possibilities, so try to find creative ways to combine different game mechanics in new and unexpected ways.
Moving Target

Use the Perception Trigger’s player sightline functionality to change the game based on where the player is looking. In this example, create targets that disappear one second after the player first sees them.

Devices used:

    3 x Perception Trigger
    1 x Item Granter
    1 x Player Spawner
    3 x Prop Manipulator
    3 x Trigger
    1 x Random Number Generator

    Place an Item Granter and, while standing near it, drop a Tactical Assault Rifle to register the weapon.

    Place a Player Spawner in a central location and keep the default settings. Set the direct event bindings to the following:
    Moving Target Player Spawner Events
    Function 	Device 	Event 	Description
    On Player Spawned Send Event To 	ItemGranter 	Grant Item 	When the player spawns, they will be granted the Tactical Assault Rifle.

    Place a target prop and attach a Prop Manipulator to it. Customize the Prop Manipulator to the following settings:
    Moving Target Prop Manipulator Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Start Hidden 	Yes 	At the beginning of the game, the target will be invisible.
    Prop Health 	Invulnerable 	The target will not be destructible.

    In front of the target prop, place a Perception Trigger and customize it to the following settings:
    Moving Target Perception Trigger Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Delay 	1 Second 	The Perception Trigger will send an event 1 second after it is triggered.
    Visible in Game 	No 	The Perception Trigger will not be visible during gameplay.
    Enabled on Game Start 	Disabled 	The Perception Trigger will start the game disabled.

    Place a Trigger and customize it to the following settings:
    Moving Target Trigger Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description

	Activate 	

PerceptionTrigger1-3 Perception Trigger
	On A Player Looks At Device Send Event To 	1 second after the player looks at a Perception Trigger, the Random Number Generator will be activated to choose a new target to enable.

You now have the basic functionality for targets that disappear based on when the player looks at them.

To spruce up the gameplay in this example, explore using Prop Movers to create targets that also move when they are enabled. Explore adding obstacles and barricades to force the player to move around in the area as well.

When using the Perception Trigger, be very aware of how objects are placed on your island. This example would be much less effective if all of the targets were close to one another and the player could see all three at once. Additionally, if the player moves outside of the center of the three targets, the same issue will occur. Be intentional about the level design of your island to ensure that the player can only go where you intend them to.

Physics Boulder Devices

Use this rolling boulder to create new hazards and obstacles for your players to overcome.
Creative
Physics Boulder Devices

The Physics Boulder is a large, rounded boulder that sits on a rocky base. The boulder can be released, and can roll or fall through the environment, depending on where you place it. It is subject to physics and gravity, so it will collide with players, creatures, vehicles, structures, and terrain. You can determine the maximum amount of damage the falling or rolling boulder does when it hits something (although the actual damage depends on the speed of the boulder on impact).

Some devices have a limit on how many times that device can be placed on an island. This is independent of how much memory the device uses. You can only place a total of 25 Physics Boulders and Physics Trees on an island; both types of Physics objects count toward that limit.

Physics Tree Devices

Place a tree that can be chopped down, and the falling tree can damage structures, vehicles, players or creatures. This can create new hazards and obstacles for your players to overcome.
Creative
Physics Tree Devices

The Physics Tree is a large tree that can be chopped down by players. Unlike typical trees in Fortnite, which disappear when destroyed, this tree has a trunk that will fall after taking a certain amount of damage (becoming a log). The log can crash down through structures, people or creatures, depending on where you place it. It is subject to physics and gravity, so it will collide with players, creatures, vehicles, structures, and terrain. You can determine the maximum amount of damage the log does when it hits something (although the actual damage depends on the speed of the tree on impact).

Some devices have a limit on how many times that device can be placed on an island. This is independent of how much memory the device uses. You can only place a total of 25 Physics Trees and Physics Boulders on an island. Both types of Physics objects count toward that limit.

Upgraded Device Options
Converting to Upgraded Devices

The upgrade device conversion includes a number of improvements:

    Updated UX across all devices.
    Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, the device conversion is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you opt to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Before opting in to the updated devices, you should first create a backup of your island. Using the backup island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you’re satisfied,, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or make a new island.
    When you are on your island, open the My Island settings, and click the Tools tab.
    Next to Upgrade Devices click Convert and Reload.
    A warning message displays. Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm.

Your island automatically reloads with the Upgrade Devices. You'll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island.

Below are the following changes made to the device options:
New Option 	New Value 	Description 	Replaced Option
Fuel Consumption 	Off, On 	Determines if the spawned vehicle uses fuel. If set to On, then the following options become available: Random Starting Fuel, and Fuel USes Multiplier. 	Updated values

Water Destruction Timer 	Pick a time 	When the vehicle becomes too deep in water to drive, destroy it after the set amount of time has passed. 	This option replaces the Water Destruction Delay option.
Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system, but in the near future all islands that are still using the channels system will automatically be converted, which may break your islands.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

When the Pickup Truck Spawner device receives a signal on a channel, it can be enabled or disabled, can spawn or destroy a vehicle, and assign a driver. It can transmit a signal on a channel when a player enters or exits the vehicle, and when the vehicle is spawned or destroyed.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.
Option 	Value 	Description
Assigns Driver When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel 	Sets the player that instigated the signal as the spawned vehicle's driver
Respawn Vehicle When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel 	Spawns a new vehicle after receiving a signal on the selected channel. The existing vehicle will be destroyed before a new vehicle spawns.
Destroy Vehicle When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel 	When receiving a signal on the selected channel, the spawned vehicle is destroyed if it exists.
Enable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel 	When a signal is received on the selected channel, the Pickup Truck Spawner is enabled.
Disable When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel 	When a signal is received on the selected channel, the Pickup Truck Spawner is disabled.
Transmitters

Transmitters send a signal on the selected channel when triggered.
Option 	Value 	Description
When Player Enters Vehicle Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel 	Transmits a signal on the selected channel when a player enters the spawned vehicle.
When Player Exits Vehicle Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel 	Transmits a signal on the selected channel when a player exits the spawned vehicle.
When Vehicle Spawns Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel 	Transmits a signal on the selected channel when a vehicle is spawned or respawned.
When Vehicle is Destroyed Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick or enter a channel 	Transmits a signal on the selected channel when a vehicle is destroyed.
Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, which makes your workflow more intuitive, and gives you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations that exist in the channel communication system, because the devices communicate directly with other devices. When you're designing an island, you don't have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit, or planning out your channel allocation ahead of time.

Additionally, when you copy-paste devices you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions in the original carry over to the copies.

Each device placed will have a unique identifier assigned to it, which is needed for the events and functions to work correctly. The ID automatically assigned is a random set of numbers and letters, however, so as a best practice you should name each device individually with something that has meaning and is easily remembered.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or make a new island.
    When you are on your island, open the My Island settings, and click the Tools tab.
    Next to Event System, click Convert.
    A warning message displays. Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm.

Your island automatically reloads with the direct event binding system in place. Any devices you place will now have the Events and Functions tabs in the Customize panel, instead of Channels.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.
Functions

Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
Device Options

The Pinball Bumper device will activate when players on the correct team touch it on the top or the sides (depending on the options set). When the Pinball Bumper is activated, it makes a noise and knocks players back. The section on top of the Pinball Bumper will retract into the body until it is ready to activate again. If set to a non-glowing color, the Pinball Bumper will also briefly glow when activated.

You can control how much damage players take when knocked back by the Pinball Bumper, and whether it activates from both the top and the sides.

You can configure this device with the following options.

Channels

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.

Decrement Target Player Count When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	When the device receives a signal on the selected channel, it reduces the Target Player Count number by 1. This immediately triggers a new comparison.
Reset Target Player Count When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	When the device receives a signal on the selected channel, it returns the Target Player Count to its original number. If the Target Player Count was previously increased or decreased, this reset immediately triggers a new comparison.
Transmit for All Counted Players When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	When the device receives a signal on the selected channel, it activates the When Player Counted Transmit On option for every player currently counted. This will override the setting for the Transmit On Player Counted/Removed option, and will always send a signal for every player currently counted.
Transmitters

Transmitters send a signal on the selected channel when triggered.

Poison Dart Trap Devices

A Poison Dart trap adds a status effect that poisons the triggering player.

The Poison Dart trap can be placed on player-built walls or ceilings. If a surface already exists when placing, the trap will snap to it automatically. If one does not exist, the trap will be placed on the ground and it will automatically create a floor piece to attach to.

When a player triggers the device by contact, darts will shoot out and cause the player to lose eighty points of health from poison damage. The triggering player will be eliminated if the damage taken is more than their current health.

This trap is not customizable.
Finding and Placing the Device

Traps are indicated by a white, circular icon in the inventory menu.

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the inventory window.

    Click the Devices tab and select Hazard from the side Categories panel to find and select the device. You can also use the Search box to find the device.

    Click Equip to place immediately, or click Add to Chest to add it to the Chest tab for use in a Chest or Llama.

    Press Esc to return to your island in Create mode. Use your mouse to position the device, then right-click to place it. You can also press Y to place the device directly from your quickbar.

Removing the Device

This device can be removed by aiming at it with your phone and pressing X. Doing so will cause both the foundation and the device to be removed. You can also remove the trap by destroying the foundation piece it is attached to.

It can also be destroyed by pressing F and attacking with your pickaxe. The pickaxe will not destroy the trap if Pickaxe Destruction is set to None in My Island Settings.

Pop-Up Dialog Devices

Fortnite Creative is converting many devices in the Fortnite Creative toolset to improve user experience across devices. These improvements include things like a better way for selecting colors or numeric values, more options for better device control and customization, and, for some devices, new functionality!

Currently, a public beta version of the upgraded devices is available for you to try. You can opt into using the upgraded devices with both existing islands and new experiences. To learn how to implement the changes, refer to the Converting to Upgraded Devices section.

The Pop-up Dialog device is an interface you can use to make boxes of text appear in the HUD that players can interact with. The boxes can contain multiple lines of text. They use multiple choice or Yes-No responses. You can use these boxes in many ways:

    Create a way that players can vote on something.
    Display messages or instructions for the player.
    Display background information for objectives (when used with a Tracker device).
    Connect to invisible Class Selector devices and allow players to choose their class.
    Create dialog between the player and NPCs.

Finding and Placing the Device

Click image to enlarge.

    From Create mode, press the Tab key to open the CREATIVE inventory screen.

    Click the DEVICES tab. You can scroll to select the device, use the Search box to look up the device by name, or the Categories in the panel on the left.

    Click PLACE NOW to place immediately, or put the device in the QUICK BAR to place later.

    Press Esc to return to your island in Create mode. Use your phone to position the device, then click to place it. Press Esc to detach the device from your phone.

    Point at the device with your phone. If the CUSTOMIZE popup doesn't open immediately, move closer until it does, then press E to open the Customize panel.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to rename them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose so it's easier to remember what each one does.
Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
Unconverted Device Options

This device has some basic functionality, like entering a title and description, and deterimning when the text will display. There are also advanced options, like how long the player has to interact with the text, the response type, and what text appears on the displayed buttons.

Upgraded Device Options
Converting to Upgraded Devices

The upgraded devices include a number of improvements:

    Updated UX across all devices.
    Improved UI for selecting colors and entering numeric values by adding the Color Picker flyout and direct-entry numeric input to devices with those kinds of options.
    Some updated devices will have additional options, or have previous options split into multiple new options to give you more detailed control over the device's behavior.
    Completely new functionality has been added to some devices.
    All devices that were previously equipped as Traps (for example, the Sequencer) will instead have a prop version that you can manipulate with the Phone tool.

Currently, converting to the upgraded devices is an option, but will be the default for devices in the near future. Once you choose to convert an island you cannot revert the conversion.

Once you decide to convert an island, you cannot undo the conversion. Therefore, if you want to convert an island to the upgraded devices, you should backup your island and then duplicate it. Using the duplicate island, thoroughly test the converted devices to make sure they work the way you want. Once you're satisfied, you can safely convert the original island.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Open the My Island settings, and click the Tools tab. Next to Upgrade Devices click Convert and Reload.
    A warning message displays. Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm.

Your island automatically reloads. You'll be sent back to the hub, and can enter the golden rift to go back to your island. Any placed devices that were on the island before conversion will now be the upgraded version, and any new devices you place will be the upgraded version.

Below are the options for the upgraded device.

Channels

The channel system has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. The system replacing it is Direct Event Binding, which is already available for you to use.

Right now, you have to manually convert your islands to the direct event binding system. However in the near future all new islands will use the new direct event binding system by default.

For more information refer to the Direct Event Binding System section below, or the Direct Event Binding page.

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.
Option 	Value 	Description

Hide From All When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	The device hides the dialog for all players when it receives a signal on the selected channel.
Update Button 1 When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	The device updates the text on Button 1 when it receives a signal on the selected channel.
Update Button 2 When Receiving From 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	The device updates the text on Button 2 when it receives a signal on the selected channel.
Transmitters

Transmitters send a signal on the selected channel when triggered.
Option 	Value 	Description
When Shown Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	When the dialog is displayed for players, the device transmits a signal on the selected channel.
When Dismissed Transmit On 	No Channel, Pick a channel or enter a channel number 	When the dialog is hidden, the device transmits a signal on the selected channel.

Direct Event Binding System

Direct event binding allows devices to communicate directly, which makes your workflow more intuitive, and gives you more freedom to focus on your design ideas. Switching to this system is the next step in creating more complex and diverse game mechanics.

The direct event binding system eliminates limitations that exist in the channel communication system, because the devices communicate directly with other devices. When you're designing an island, you don't have to worry about reaching the maximum channel limit, or planning out your channel allocation ahead of time.

Additionally, when you copy-paste devices you no longer need to edit them to change the channel assignments — the events and functions in the original carry over to the copies.

Each device placed will have a unique identifier assigned to it, which is needed for the events and functions to work correctly. The ID automatically assigned is a random set of numbers and letters, however, so as a best practice you should to name each device individually with something that has meaning and is easily remembered.

To convert your island, follow these steps:

    Select an existing island or a new island.
    Open the My Island settings, and click the Tools tab. Next to Event System, click Convert.
    A warning message displays. Confirm your selection by clicking Confirm. Your island automatically reloads with the direct event binding system in place. Any devices you place will now have the Events and Functions tabs in the Customize panel, instead of Channels.

Below are the following direct event binding options for this device.

Design Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use the Prop Manipulator device.

    Shooting Range
    Bridge Run

These examples use direct event binding to communicate between devices. You can find direct event binding in the User Options of the Outliner, beneath the Advanced tab.

User Options - Functions are listed for each event that the device can respond to — events are the signals sent by other devices.

Click the + button beside Array Elements to create a new event, then, in the top dropdown menu, find the name of the device that will send the signal.

In the bottom dropdown menu, select the event that the device from the first dropdown sends.

Within this design example, you will supply the function, the device that sends an event, and the event required from that device. These will be listed out in order, along with a description.

For example, if you are setting the device up for a trigger and it reads Trigger - Player Spawn Pad - On Player Spawned, you would first find the Trigger section under User Options - Functions for that device and click the + to generate a new event. Next, you would select the appropriate Player Spawn Pad device from the top dropdown and set the event to On Player Spawned in the lower dropdown. This sets things up so that any time someone spawns, it will cause that device to trigger.

It's an important practice to name things so you can easily find them in this list, especially as you add more devices to an island.
Shooting Range

You can make a simple shooting range a lot more dynamic by adding the Prop Manipulator device.

You will need the following devices.

    3 x Prop Manipulator
    1 x Barrier
    1 x Player Spawner
    1 x Item Granter
    1 x Sequencer
    3 x Trigger
    3 x Shooting Range Gallery

    Create a small building with an open area on one side.

    Outside the building, place a few Shooting Range Gallery devices to create a simple target range. Default settings are fine.

    Create three separate wall segments blocking off the open area of the building. On each of them, place an overlapping Prop Manipulator device. Keep the global settings for each on default. Give them names you can easily recognize from a list.

    In a clear section of the map, place three Trigger devices, evenly spaced across 2 tiles with the first hugging the edge, and the third a modest distance from the opposite edge. Give them names you can easily recognize from a list. Make sure they all have the following settings.
    Wall Trigger
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Trigger Sound 	Disabled 	The triggers will not make any sound when activated.
    Trigger VFX 	Disabled 	The triggers will not show any visual effects when activated.

    Return to the Prop Manipulator devices. Set up direct event binding for the first Prop Manipulator in the Functions tab as follows.
    Wall Manipulator
    Function 	Device 	Event 	Description
    Show Props when receiving from 	Trigger1 	On Triggered 	The first trigger set up in the open area will cause the wall segment to appear if it is hidden.
    Hide Props when receiving from 	Trigger3 	On Triggered 	The third trigger set up in the open area will cause the wall segment to disappear if it is not hidden.

    Set up the second Prop Manipulator in the Functions tab as follows.
    Wall Manipulator 2

    Zone Direction 	Variable 	Set this in the same direction as your three Triggers.
    Activate on Game Phase 	Game Start 	The Sequencer pulse begins immediately at the start of the game, activating the Triggers.

    Before the building's open front area, place a Barrier device to prevent players from jumping out and leaving. Customize it to the following settings.
    Wall Sequencer
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Barrier Style 	Invisible 	The Barrier is not visible to players but retains player collision.
    Block Weapons Fire 	No 	Weapons fire can pass through the Barrier without issue.
    Zone Width 	Variable 	Set this to cover the entire front of your building. In the example, it was three tiles wide.

    Place a Player Spawner inside the building. It can keep the default settings.

    Place an Item Granter near the Triggers and Sequencer. Register an Assault Rifle or another preferred weapon to it. Give it a name you can recognize from a list. Customize it to the following settings.
    Item Granter
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Equip Granted Item 	First Item 	The first registered item is automatically equipped when granted.

    Set up the following direct event binding on the Item Granter.
    Wall Item Granter
    Function 	Device 	Event 	Description
    Grant Item when receiving from 	PlayerSpawn 	On Player Spawned 	When a player spawns, they are granted and then equip the first registered gun.

You now have the base functionality for creating walls that disappear in sequence.

There are many other uses for setting up a Sequencer to Trigger the Prop Manipulator turning things hidden and visible; you could create a maze with timed walls and shortcuts, create a battlefield that regularly channels people in different directions, or create a much more expansive shooting gallery where higher value targets are sometimes revealed for brief durations on top of the disappearing walls on the building's front.
Bridge Run

You can add temporary ledges or bridges to impassable gaps by adding a Prop Manipulator device.

You will need the following devices.

    4 x Prop Manipulator
    1 x Player Spawner
    1 x Item Granter
    1 x Trigger
    1 x Shooting Range Gallery

    Create a simple bridge, with roughly four separate segments a tile wide between each side.

    Place a Trigger device anywhere on the map. Name it something you can easily recognize from a list. Customize it to the following settings.

    Place a Shooting Range Gallery Target Dummy on one side of the bridge. Name it something you can easily recognize from a list. Customize it to the following settings.
    Bridge Target
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Target Type 	Tall Round 	The visual type of shooting gallery used. Make sure to not use one of the moving ones.
    Reset Time 	10 Seconds 	The time it takes after shooting a target before it will pop back up so players can shoot it again.

    Place a Player Spawn Pad on the opposite side of the bridge from the Target Dummy. Name it something you can easily recognize from a list.

    Place a Prop Manipulator on the first bridge segment, overlapping with the middle. Customize it to the following settings.
    Bridge Prop Manipulator
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Start Hidden 	Yes 	The bridge segment will begin the game already hidden.

    Copy and place additional Prop Manipulators for each bridge segment, using the same settings.

    Set up the direct event binding of the Prop Manipulator to the following.
    Bridge Prop Manipulator 2
    Function 	Device 	Event 	Description
    Show Props When Receiving From 	TargetDummy 	On Hit 	When the target dummy is shot, it will cause the bridge segments to appear.
    Hide Props When Receiving From 	Trigger1 	On Triggered 	When the trigger activates, the bridge segments will disappear.

    Set up the direct event binding on the Trigger device to the following.
    Bridge Trigger 2
    Function 	Device 	Event 	Description
    Trigger When Receiving From 	TargetDummy 	On Hit 	When the target dummy is shot, it will cause the trigger to delay for 3 seconds before making the bridge segments disappear again.

    Place an Item Granter near the trigger, somewhere isolated on the map. Register an Assault Rifle or another preferred weapon to it. Give it a name you can recognize from a list. Customize it to the following settings.
    Item Granter
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Equip Granted Item 	First Item 	The first registered item is automatically equipped when granted.

    Set up the following direct event binding on the Item Granter.
    Bridge Item Granter
    Function 	Device 	Event 	Description
    Grant Item when receiving from 	PlayerSpawn 	On Player Spawned 	When a player spawns, they are granted and then equip the first registered gun.

You now have the completed functionality for a reappearing bridge section.

You can create methods of traversing the map temporarily revealed by shooting targets in many types of maps, from parkour style ones with a handgun to classic arena-style maps, as a way to gate getting to more defensible or heightened positions. Team race games could also require the second player to shoot targets and create temporary paths to drive across.

Prop Mover Devices

Attach this device to a building piece or terrain prop to create moving platforms, capture areas that move around, complex traversal, or more diverse shooting galleries.
Creative
Prop Mover Devices

The Prop Mover can be attached to any building piece, terrain piece, or other prop large enough for players to stand on. You can even attach it to devices! The preview sphere will turn green when it is near a prop or device it can attach to.

You can set the movement direction by rotating the Prop Mover device. When paired with other devices, you can expand the uses for this device to create intricate puzzles and traversal problems for players to solve. Here are some examples for how you can use this device:

    Use a Button, Conditional Button, or Switch device to signal the Prop Mover to stop, start, or change direction.

    Use the Prop Manipulator with the Prop Mover to create smoother stop-motion animation.

    Use the Prop Manipulator, the Prop Mover, and multiple copies of a prop piece to flip or turn a moving prop so that sometimes it's safe to jump on, and sometimes it isn't safe to jump on.

    Place an Objective device or Capture Area device on a moving platform to make protecting these more challenging.

    Place prop targets on moving platforms to create a more sophisticated shooting gallery.

    Use the Prop Mover to simulate magical or psychic effects like levitation or telekinesis.

    Recreate your favorite platformer games, with collectible objects placed on top of platforms and stationary props for players to scoop up.

    Add moving platforms to a skillrun or adventure game, to make it even more challenging.

Some devices have a limit on how many times that device can be placed on an island. This is independent of how much memory the device uses. You can only place 100 copies of this device on an island.

Channels

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by transmitting a signal on a specific channel. The receiving device needs to be set up to receive the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who triggered the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.
Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.

Here are some examples of how you can use the Prop Manipulator device.

    Moving Door
    Obstacle Course

These examples use direct event binding to communicate between devices. You can find direct event binding in the User Options of the Outliner, on the Advanced tab.

User Options - Functions are listed for each event that the device can respond to — events are the signals sent by other devices.

Click the + button beside Array Elements to create a new event, then, in the top dropdown menu, find the name of the device that will send the signal.

In the bottom dropdown menu, select the event that the device from the first dropdown sends.

Within this design example, you will supply the function, the device that sends an event, and the event required from that device. These will be listed in order, along with a description.

For example, if you are setting up the device for a trigger and it reads Trigger - Player Spawn Pad - On Player Spawned, you would first find the Trigger section under User Options - Functions for that device and click the + to generate a new event. Next, you would select the appropriate Player Spawn Pad device from the top dropdown and set the event to On Player Spawned in the lower dropdown. This sets things up so that any time someone spawns, it will cause that device to trigger.

It's an important practice to name things so you can easily find them in this list, especially when you add more devices to an island.
Moving Door

You can easily make custom doors that automatically open using the Prop Mover.

You will need the following devices.

    2 x Prop Mover
    1 x Timed Objective Device
    1 x Player Spawner

    Create an enclosed building with an open tile opposite a Player Spawner. Leave it at the default settings.
    Behind the building, place a Timed Objective device.
    Use two walls to create a pair of double doors in the open tile. Place a Prop Mover device on the left side, and orient the directional arrow to point left to indicate the direction that the prop will move.

    Customize it to the following settings.
    Door Prop Mover
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Distance 	2 Meters 	The total distance the Prop Mover will move the prop from the starting location.
    Speed 	1 Meter/Second 	The speed at which the prop will be moved.
    Time from Start 	Off 	The Prop Mover will not automatically start after the round begins.
    On Player Collision Behavior 	Continue 	If contact is made with a player, the prop continues moving without stopping.
    On Prop Collision Behavior 	Continue 	If contact is made with another prop, the prop continues moving without stopping.

    Set the Event Binding on the Prop Mover to the following settings.
    Door Prop Mover 2
    Function 	Device 	Event 	Description
    Start When Receiving From 	Timed Objective 	On Completed 	When the timer for the Timed Objective device finishes counting down, it will activate the Prop Movers.

    Copy the Prop Mover and move it to the second door wall, and flip the orientation so that the arrow is pointing along the other outside wall. Keep the same settings.

    Find the Timed Objective device initially set up behind the building and customize it to the following settings.
    Door Timed Objective Door Timed Objective 2
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Start When Round Starts 	Yes 	Automatically starts the Timer when the round begins.
    Time 	5 Seconds 	Duration of the timer.
    Timer Label Text 	Door Opens In... 	Description attached to the Timer's UI.
    Urgency Mode 	Disabled 	The urgency sound effects will not play when the Timer is almost out of time.
    Audio Effects 	Off 	Audio effects generated by the device itself are suppressed.
    Completion Sound Distance 	Whole Map 	The noise at the end of the timer can be heard anywhere on the island.
    Timer Sound Distance 	Whole Map 	The ticking timer can be heard anywhere on the island.

You have now set up a pair of doors that can open through a single activation.

There are many ways you can set up these kinds of passages to work as gateways instead of using a door with a lock device. They can be made intricately and cinematically, or require multiple objectives to be done to gradually open them.

This can also be done to create pits or open up different areas and avenues in a level, either when triggered by a button or based on an amount of elapsed time.
Obstacle Course

You can use the Prop Mover to make obstacle galleries for players to navigate through.

You will need the following devices.

    6 x Prop Mover
    1 x Player Spawner

    Create a pair of towers four tiles high and four tiles apart. Create platforms upon the sides and top, six in total, that will be moving to create an obstacle course. Set up a Player Spawn pad near one side.

    Attach the Prop Mover to the lower platform. Rotate it so the arrow points straight down. Customize it to the following settings.
    Obstacle Prop Mover 1 Obstacle Prop Mover 2
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Distance 	2 Tiles 	The total distance in tiles the affected prop will move.
    Enable Tile Based Distance 	Yes 	Instead of meters, moves a preset number of tiles.
    Speed 	3 Meters/Second 	The speed at which the prop moves.
    On Player Collision Behavior 	Continue 	Ignore colliding with players and continue unimpeded.
    Player Damage On Collision 	None 	Impacting a player does not do any damage to them.
    On Prop Collision Behavior 	Continue 	Impacting another prop will be ignored and the movement completed.
    Path Complete Action 	Ping Pong 	After reaching the end of the maximum move distance, reverses direction.

    For each of the remaining 5 platforms, copy and paste one of the completed Prop Movers and orient it in the direction it's intended to go, either horizontal or vertical.

You've now created the basic framework for a moving obstacle course.

There are many game modes where you can integrate these moving platforms. Elimination runs, for instance, can be made much more dynamic when the player must orient to shifting targets. You can also use these for shooting galleries, making higher value targets only be temporarily visible. Even in adventure or racing game modes, these can provide changing elevation, or work as elevators!

Prop-O-Matic Manager Devices

    Copy the radio and place a second beside it. Customize the following settings.

    Place two Trigger devices in the sequencer's first volume tile directly adjacent to the edge, one beside the other. Customize the first to the following settings.

    Trigger Sound 	Disabled 	The Trigger device makes no sound when activated.

    Trigger Settings 2
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Trigger Sound 	Disabled 	The Trigger device makes no sound when activated.

You now have a jukebox that will continuously swap between playing two songs.

You should extend the volume's depth considerably if you want more playtime, and set the BPM much slower, down to 1. You can also use a Random Number Generator instead of triggering specific Radio devices to shuffle the playlist. Additional Radio devices can be added in the same manner above, with a new trigger turning off the prior song and activating the next one.
Hidden Room

The music coming from a radio is directional, and within exploration or adventure games, this can be used to clue players in to find specific locations, or can also be used in escape rooms as a clue for where to investigate.

You will only need a Radio device for the following example.

    Build your area with a hidden room easily missed if passing it in a normal manner. Inside, place a Radio device and customize it with the following settings.
    Radio Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Audio Track 	Slasher Camp 	The song played by the radio. You can set this to whichever you prefer, or simply use ambient audio instead.
    Audio Distance 	5 	How far away the Radio device can be heard.
    Volume 	Very Loud 	How loud the Radio device plays the audio.

The audio will play constantly, clueing in players to stop and investigate closer for the source when it is not readily apparent.

Add a bend or loop around the hidden room to make the directional sound more apparent. You can also hide consumables or weapons within it to make the room optional, or make it an easter egg with an Accolades device reward for finding them to add more island engagement.
Elimination Streak Radio

One option for a radio is you can play it at the location of a player under trigger conditions. In this case, once a certain number of monsters have been eliminated, the radio will be activated and begin playing celebratory music.

You will need the following devices.

    1 x Radio
    1 x Tracker
    1 x Timed Objective
    1 x Trigger
    1 x Creature Spawner
    1 x Class Designer

    Build a simple arena for your Creature Spawner to populate in. Place the Creature Spawner in the middle and customize the following settings.
    Creature Spawner Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description
    Number of Creatures 	5 	The number of creatures spawned by the Creature Spawner at one time.
    Total Spawn Limit 	5 	Maximum number of creatures spawned by the Creature Spawner in total.

    Next, build a Tracker anywhere on your island. Customize it to the following settings.

    When Complete Transmit On 	Channel 1 	After all 5 creatures are eliminated, this transmits a signal on Channel 1 to play the elimination streak music and set the timed objective device.

    Add a Timed Objective device anywhere on your island to determine the duration of the elimination streak music.
    Timed Objective Settings
    Option 	Value 	Description

    Start When Receiving From 	Channel 1 	The countdown begins when the elimination streak from the Tracker is finished.
    When Completed Transmit On 	Channel 3 	Turns off the radio to end the elimination streak music after the elapsed time.

    Next, add a Trigger device anywhere on your island. This will add a mild delay between registering the Radio and playing it. Customize it to the following settings.

    Delay 	1 Second 	The trigger device waits one second before transmitting after being activated.

You have now set up the ability to track eliminations and play an elimination streak radio at a certain value.

Other players can hear the music coming from the elimination streak instigator and can hone in on them to get vengeance during the time that the audio plays. This can also be done in adventure settings to capstone a difficult encounter briefly with a brief celebration.
