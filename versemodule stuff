A Verse module is an atomic unit of code that can be redistributed and depended upon, and can evolve over time without breaking dependencies. You can import a module into your Verse file to use code definitions from other Verse files.

A Verse module is specified by the folder in the file hierarchy of the project, and the module's name is the name of the folder. All .verse files in the same folder as the file are part of that Verse module, and can access definitions from the other Verse files in the module without explicitly importing the module.

A module is identified by its path; for example, /Verse.org/Verse. Verse paths provide a global namespace for identifying things, and borrow from the idea of web domains. These paths are persistent and unique, and discoverable by any Verse programmer.

For a list of existing Verse modules, see the Verse API Reference.

Module Members
You can create modules within a .verse file using the following syntax:

module1 := module:
    ...

# Similar to classes and function, bracket syntax is also supported
module2 := module
{
    ...
}
A module defined in the Verse file can contain anything that is contained at the top level of a .verse file. This includes functions, constants, various types, as well as other module definitions. For example:

module := module:
    submodule<public> := module:
        submodule_class<public> := class {}
    module_class<public> := class{}
The contents of a submodule can be referred to using the name of the module qualified with the name of the base module. For example, class1 can be referred to outside of module1 as module1.module2.class1.

Importing Definitions from Other Verse Files
To use the contents of a Verse module, you must import the module by its path. For example, the following code imports the Random module, identified by the path /Verse.org/Random:

using { /Verse.org/Random }
When the Random module is imported into your Verse file, you can use its code definitions, such as the function GetRandomInt().

Other common module examples include the Devices, Simulation, and Diagnostics modules, all of which are imported by default when you create a new Verse file through UEFN.

using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }
To import modules from other Verse files, you can use either a local path such as using { /YourVerseFolder/your_module }, or if the file is in the same directory, just using { your_module }.

You can import nested modules either by importing base modules before submodule modules, or by using dotted notation. For instance, given the modules:

base_module<public> := module:
    submodule<public> := module:
        submodule_class := class:
            ...
If you want to access members in submodule, you can either import it by importing base_module before submodule, or by importing base_module.submodule. Note that importing submodule before base_module will produce an error.

# Works and imports both base and submodules
using { base_module }
using { submodule }

# Works and imports only the submodule
using { base_module.submodule }

# Does not work
using { submodule }
using { base_module }
When you create a subfolder in a Verse project, a module is automatically created for that folder. For example, if base_module was defined in a folder module_folder, then module_folder would have its own module that contains base_module.

Another way to view this is that the file structure module_folder/base_module is the same as the following:

module_folder := module:
    base_module := module:
        submodule := module:
            submodule_class := class:
                ...
Note that the module for module_folder would need to be imported before base_module.

# Imports the folder containing base_module and its submodule
using { module_folder }
using { base_module }
using { submodule }
Access of Definitions in a Module
The access of a module and its contents from other Verse files are set using access specifiers, such as public and internal.

By default, the access for definitions are internal, which means they're only discoverable within their own module. This is also true for modules introduced by folders in a project.

Because the default access specifier is internal, you can't access module members outside of the module without making them public. For instance:

# This module and its members are not accesible from other Verse Files.
private_module := module:
    SecretInt:int = 1
    ...

# But this module, its submodule, and its members are.
public_module<public> := module:
    public_submodule<public> := module:
        PublicInt<public>:int = 1
        ...
Note both the module and its members need to be public to access them in a different scope.

Verse API version: 26.20.

Welcome to the Verse API Reference! This is an automatically generated reference manual from the modules that currently exist in Verse. You can find all modules and their members here, organized hierarchically. We recommend you begin by browsing the modules, or using the left-side search bar to filter for a known term, such as a class or function name.

To get started, browse the following expanded, hierarchical list of all Verse modules. Everything that you can use in the Verse API exists within one of these modules. You can click on any module to go to its page, where you will find links to all of its direct members (such as classes, enumerated types, and so on), as well as related modules. You can also use the left-side content panel to browse through all API members.

UEFNfort_character interface
Main API implemented by Fortnite characters.

 	 
Verse using statement	using { /Fortnite.com/Characters }
Exposed Interfaces
This interface exposes the following interfaces:

Name	Description
positional	
Implemented by objects to allow reading position information.

healable	
Implemented by Fortnite objects that can be healed.

healthful	
Implemented by Fortnite objects that have health state and can be eliminated.

damageable	
Implemented by Fortnite objects that can be damaged.

shieldable	
Implemented by Fortnite objects that have shields. A shield is a method of protection that can take incoming damage while leaving the health state unchanged.

game_action_instigator	
Implemented by Fortnite objects that initiate game actions, such as damage and heal. For example, player or agents. Event listeners often use game_action_instigators to calculate player damage scores.

game_action_causer	
Implemented by Fortnite objects that can be passed through game action events, such as damage and heal. For example: player, vehicle, or weapon.

Event Listeners often use game_action_causer to pass along additional information about what weapon caused the damage. Systems will then use that information for completing quests or processing game specific event logic.

InterpolationTypes
Classes and Structs
Name	Description
cubic_bezier_parameters	
A structure for defining Bezier interpolation parameters. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve for more info on Bezier curves.

keyframe_delta	
Instead of specifying the actual keyframe positions, we specify the keyframe deltas. This allows us to treat the initial position of the prop as keyframe 0 and avoid the question of how to get the prop to its initial location. For a animation_mode.Loop animation, the net rotation and translation must both be zero. Each delta is interpreted as a world-space transformation to be concatenated onto the previous transform(s).

animation_controller	
Used to move and animate the position of creative_prop objects.

See creative_prop.GetAnimationController for information on acquiring an instance of an animation_controller for a given creative_prop.

operator'-'	
Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from the component-wise difference of c0 and c1.

operator'*'	
Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from the component-wise product of c0 and c1.

operator'*'	
Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from each component of c scaled by factor.

operator'/'	
Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from each component of c divided by factor.

operator'/'	
Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from each component of c divided by factor.

MakeColorFromSRGB	
Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from sRGB components Red, Green, and Blue. Normal sRGB component values are between 0.0 and 1.0, but this can handle larger values.

MakeSRGBFromColor	
Makes an sRGB tuple by converting InColor from an ACES 2065-1 color to sRGB.

MakeColorFromSRGBValues	
Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from the integer sRGB components Red, Green, and Blue. Valid sRGB component values are between '0' and '255', inclusive.

MakeColorFromHex	
Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from a CSS-style sRGB hexString. Supported formats are:

RGB
RRGGBB
RRGGBBAA
RGB
RRGGBB
RRGGBBAA
An invalid hex string will return Black.

MakeColorFromHSV	
Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from Hue, Saturation, and Value components. Components use the HSV color model in the sRGB color space. Expected ranges:

0.0 <= Hue <= 360.0
0.0 <= Saturation <= 1.0
0.0 <= Value <= 1.0 Values out of expected ranges will undergo range reduction and conversion.
MakeHSVFromColor	
Makes an HSV tuple by converting InColor from an ACES 2065-1 color to sRGB and applying the HSV color model.

MakeColorFromTemperature	
Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from the chromaticity of a blackbody radiator at Temperature Kelvin. Temperature is clamped such that 0 <= Temperature.

session	
Type for which there is a single instance per round. Use GetSession to get the current round's session instance. May be used with weak_map to implement global variables. Note: may be changed in a future release to a single instance per game. Round-local behavior should not be relied upon.

Functions
Name	Description
GetSession	
Returns the session corresponding to the current round. The result can be used with weak_map to implement global variables. Note: may be changed in a future release to return a single instance per game. Round-local behavior should not be relied upon.

Sleep	
Waits specified number of seconds and then resumes. If Seconds = 0.0 then it waits until next tick/frame/update. If Seconds = Inf then it waits forever and only calls back if canceled - such as via race. If Seconds < 0.0 then it completes immediately and does not yield to other aysnc expressions. Waiting until the next update (0.0) is especially useful in a loop of a coroutine that needs to do some work every update and this yields to other coroutines so that it doesn't hog a processor's resources. Waiting forever (Inf) will have any expression that follows never be evaluated. Occasionally it is desireable to have a task never complete such as the last expression in a race subtask where the task must never win the race though it still may be canceled earlier. Immediately completing (less than 0) is useful when you want programmatic control over whether an expression yields or not.

GetSimulationElapsedTime	
Get the seconds that have elapsed since the world began simulating

Returns the cosine of X if IsFinite(X). Returns NaN if `not IsFinite(X)

Tan	
Returns the tangent of X if IsFinite(X). Returns NaN if `not IsFinite(X).

ArcSin	
Returns the inverse sine (arcsine) of X if -1.0 <= X <= 1.0.

ArcCos	
Returns the inverse cosine (arccosine) of X if -1.0 <= X <= 1.0.

ArcTan	
Returns the inverse tangent (arctangent) of X such that:-PiFloat/2.0 <= ArcTan(x) <= PiFloat/2.0.

ArcTan	
Returns the angle in radians at the origin between a ray pointing to (X, Y) and the positive X axis such that -PiFloat < ArcTan(Y, X) <= PiFloat. Returns 0.0 if X=0.0 and Y=0.0.

Sinh	
Returns the hyperbolic sine of X.

Cosh	
Returns the hyperbolic cosine of X.

Tanh	
Returns the hyperbolic tangent of X.

ArSinh	
Returns the inverse hyperbolic sine of X if IsFinite(X).

ArCosh	
Returns the inverse hyperbolic cosine of X if 1.0 <= X.

ArTanh	
Returns the inverse hyperbolic tangent of X if IsFinite(X).

Pow	
Returns A to the power of B.

Quotient	
Returns the quotient X/Y as defined by Euclidean division, i.e.:

Quotient[X/Y] = Floor[X/Y] when Y > 0
Quotient[X/Y] = Ceil[X/Y] when Y < 0
Quotient[X/Y] * Y + Mod[X,Y] = X Fails if Y = 0.
Mod	
Returns the remainder of X/Y as defined by Euclidean division, i.e.:

Mod[X,Y] = X - Quotient(X/Y)*Y
0 <= Mod[X,Y] < Abs(Y) Fails if Y=0.
Exp	
Returns the natural exponent of X.

Ln	
Returns the natural logarithm of X.

Log	
Returns the base B logarithm of X.

Lerp	
Used to linearly interpolate/extrapolate between From (when Parameter = 0.0) and To (when Parameter = 1.0). Expects that all arguments are finite. Returns From*(1 - Parameter) + To*Parameter.

Sgn	
Returns the sign of Val:

1 if Val > 0
0 if Val = 0
-1 if Val < 0
Sgn	
Returns the sign of Val:

1.0 if Val > 0.0
0.0 if Val = 0.0
-1.0 if Val < 0.0
NaN if Val = NaN
IsAlmostEqual	
Succeeds if Val1 and Val2 are within AbsoluteTolerance of each other.

Print	
Writes Message to a dedicated Print log while displaying it in Color on the client screen for Duration seconds. By default, Color is NamedColors.White and Duration is 2.0 seconds.

signalable	
A parametric interface implemented by events with a payload that can be signaled. Can be used with awaitable, subscribable, or both (see: listenable).

Join	
Makes a string by concatenating Separator between the elements of Strings.

ToString	
Returns String without modification.

ToString	
Makes a string from Character.

subscribable	
A parametric interface implemented by events with a payload that can be subscribed to. Matched with signalable.

subscribable	
A parameterless interface implemented by events that can be subscribed to.
